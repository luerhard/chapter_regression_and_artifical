  {"id":"arikan:influencesocietalvalues.2013","abstract":"This paper examines the influence of societal values on individual attitudes towards immigration and immigrants. We argue that conflict between individual and societal values leads individuals to be exposed to frames and opinions that are contrary to their values, evokes competing considerations and creates attitudinal ambivalence and volatility. To evade ambivalence, individuals whose values are in conflict with those of their society rely less on their core values to construct their attitudes. Using data from the first wave of European Social Surveys and relying on Heteroskedastic Maximum Likelihood Regression, we test our argument simultaneously for 18 European countries and show that deviations from society’s conservation and self-transcendence values lead to greater ambivalence in attitudes towards immigration and immigrants. Our results provide evidence of the importance of the social context and society’s shared values in influencing personal political attitudes and judgments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Arikan","given":"Gizem"},{"family":"Ben-Nun Bloom","given":"Pazit"}],"citation-key":"arikan:influencesocietalvalues.2013","container-title":"International Political Science Review","container-title-short":"International Political Science Review","DOI":"10/f4pzmb","ISSN":"0192-5121, 1460-373X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,3]]},"language":"en","page":"210-226","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The influence of societal values on attitudes towards immigration","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0192512111411210","volume":"34"},

We address this question by exploiting six major compulsory\n                                schooling reforms in five Western European countries—Denmark,\n                                France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Sweden—that have\n                                recently experienced politically influential anti-immigration\n                                movements.

The result is a landmark in sociological theory, capable of describing both stability and change in social systems.This book provides for the first time a sound theoretical foundation for linking the behavior of individuals to organizational behavior and then to society as a whole. The power of the theory is especially apparent when Coleman analyzes corporate actors, such as large corporations and trade unions. He examines the creation of these institutions, collective decision making, and the processes through which authority is revoked in revolts and revolutions.Coleman discusses the problems of holding institutions responsible for their actions as well as their incompatibility with the family. He also provides a simple mathematical analysis corresponding to and carrying further the verbal formulations of the theory. Finally, he generates research techniques that will permit quantitative testing of the theory.From a simple, unified conceptual structure Coleman derives, through elegant chains of reasoning, an encompassing theory of society.

  {"id":"degraveMagneticControlTokamak2022","abstract":"Nuclear fusion using magnetic confinement, in particular in the tokamak configuration, is a promising path towards sustainable energy. A core challenge is to shape and maintain a high-temperature plasma within the tokamak vessel. This requires high-dimensional, high-frequency, closed-loop control using magnetic actuator coils, further complicated by the diverse requirements across a wide range of plasma configurations. In this work, we introduce a previously undescribed architecture for tokamak magnetic controller design that autonomously learns to command the full set of control coils. This architecture meets control objectives specified at a high level, at the same time satisfying physical and operational constraints. This approach has unprecedented flexibility and generality in problem specification and yields a notable reduction in design effort to produce new plasma configurations. We successfully produce and control a diverse set of plasma configurations on the Tokamak à Configuration Variable1,2, including elongated, conventional shapes, as well as advanced configurations, such as negative triangularity and ‘snowflake’ configurations. Our approach achieves accurate tracking of the location, current and shape for these configurations. We also demonstrate sustained ‘droplets’ on TCV, in which two separate plasmas are maintained simultaneously within the vessel. This represents a notable advance for tokamak feedback control, showing the potential of reinforcement learning to accelerate research in the fusion domain, and is one of the most challenging real-world systems to which reinforcement learning has been applied.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Degrave","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Felici","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Buchli","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Neunert","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Tracey","given":"Brendan"},{"family":"Carpanese","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Ewalds","given":"Timo"},{"family":"Hafner","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Abdolmaleki","given":"Abbas"},{"family":"Casas","given":"Diego","non-dropping-particle":"de las"},{"family":"Donner","given":"Craig"},{"family":"Fritz","given":"Leslie"},{"family":"Galperti","given":"Cristian"},{"family":"Huber","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Keeling","given":"James"},{"family":"Tsimpoukelli","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Kay","given":"Jackie"},{"family":"Merle","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Moret","given":"Jean-Marc"},{"family":"Noury","given":"Seb"},{"family":"Pesamosca","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Pfau","given":"David"},{"family":"Sauter","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Sommariva","given":"Cristian"},{"family":"Coda","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Duval","given":"Basil"},{"family":"Fasoli","given":"Ambrogio"},{"family":"Kohli","given":"Pushmeet"},{"family":"Kavukcuoglu","given":"Koray"},{"family":"Hassabis","given":"Demis"},{"family":"Riedmiller","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"degraveMagneticControlTokamak2022","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10/gpg9dn","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7897","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2]]},"language":"en","number":"7897","page":"414-419","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Magnetic control of tokamak plasmas through deep reinforcement learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04301-9","volume":"602"},

We explain how the inclusion of machine learning in the social sciences requires us to rethink not only applications of machine learning methods but also best practices in the social sciences. In contrast to the traditional tasks for machine learning in computer science and statistics, when machine learning is applied to social scientific data, it is used to discover new concepts, measure the prevalence of those concepts, assess causal effects, and make predictions. The abundance of data and resources facilitates the move away from a deductive social science to a more sequential, interactive, and ultimately inductive approach to inference.

  {"id":"hargittaiPotentialBiasesBig2020","abstract":"While big data offer exciting opportunities to address questions about social behavior, studies must not abandon traditionally important considerations of social science research such as data representativeness and sampling biases. Many big data studies rely on traces of people’s behavior on social media platforms such as opinions expressed through Twitter posts. How representative are such data? Whose voices are most likely to show up on such sites? Analyzing survey data about a national sample of American adults’ social network site usage, this article examines what user characteristics are associated with the adoption of such sites. Findings suggest that several sociodemographic factors relate to who adopts such sites. Those of higher socioeconomic status are more likely to be on several platforms suggesting that big data derived from social media tend to oversample the views of more privileged people. Additionally, Internet skills are related to using such sites, again showing that opinions visible on these sites do not represent all types of people equally. The article cautions against relying on content from such sites as the sole basis of data to avoid disproportionately ignoring the perspectives of the less privileged. Whether business interests or policy considerations, it is important that decisions that concern the whole population are not based on the results of analyses that favor the opinions of those who are already better off.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Hargittai","given":"Eszter"}],"citation-key":"hargittaiPotentialBiasesBig2020","container-title":"Social Science Computer Review","container-title-short":"Social Science Computer Review","DOI":"10/gd3w23","ISSN":"0894-4393","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"10-24","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Potential Biases in Big Data: Omitted Voices on Social Media","title-short":"Potential Biases in Big Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439318788322","volume":"38"},

  {"id":"heibergerFacetsSpecializationIts2021","abstract":"We investigate how sociology students garner recognition from niche field audiences through specialization. Our dataset comprises over 80,000 sociology-related dissertations completed at U.S. universities, as well as data on graduates’ pursuant publications. We analyze different facets of how students specialize—topic choice, focus, novelty, and consistency. To measure specialization types within a consistent methodological frame, we utilize structural topic modeling. These measures capture specialization strategies used at an early career stage. We connect them to a crucial long-term outcome in academia: becoming an advisor. Event-history models reveal that specific topic choices and novel combinations exhibit a positive influence, whereas focused theses make no substantial difference. In particular, theses related to the cultural turn, methods, or race are tied to academic careers that lead to mentorship. Thematic consistency of students’ publication track also has a strong positive effect on the chances of becoming an advisor. Yet, there are diminishing returns to consistency for highly productive scholars, adding important nuance to the well-known imperative of publish or perish in academic careers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Heiberger","given":"Raphael H."},{"family":"Munoz-Najar Galvez","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"McFarland","given":"Daniel A."}],"citation-key":"heibergerFacetsSpecializationIts2021","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10/gnndzr","ISSN":"0003-1224, 1939-8271","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12]]},"language":"en","page":"1164-1192","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Facets of Specialization and Its Relation to Career Success: An Analysis of U.S. Sociology, 1980 to 2015","title-short":"Facets of Specialization and Its Relation to Career Success","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00031224211056267","volume":"86"},
  {"id":"heibergerInstallingComputationalSocial2016","abstract":"Today’s world allows people to connect over larger distances and in shorter intervals than ever before, widely monitored by massive online data sources. Ongoing worldwide computerization has led to completely new opportunities for social scientists to conceive human interactions and relations in unknown precision and quantities. However, the large data sets require techniques that are more likely to be found in computer and natural sciences than in the established fields of social relations. In order to facilitate the participation of social scientists in an emerging interdisciplinary research branch of “computational social science,” we propose in this article the usage of the Python programming language. First, we carve out its capacity to handle “Big Data” in suitable formats. Second, we introduce programming libraries to analyze large networks and big text corpora, conduct simulations, and compare their performance to their counterparts in the R environment. Furthermore, we highlight practical tools implemented in Python for operational tasks like preparing presentations. Finally, we discuss how the process of writing code may help to exemplify theoretical concepts and could lead to empirical applications that gain a better understanding of the social processes initiated by the truly global connections of the Internet era.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Heiberger","given":"Raphael H."},{"family":"Riebling","given":"Jan R."}],"citation-key":"heibergerInstallingComputationalSocial2016","container-title":"Methodological Innovations","container-title-short":"Methodological Innovations","DOI":"10/gcd5ks","ISSN":", 2059-7991","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-11","source":"mio.sagepub.com","title":"Installing computational social science: Facing the challenges of new information and communication technologies in social science","title-short":"Installing computational social science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://mio.sagepub.com/content/9/2059799115622763","volume":"9"},

This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform. Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience.

  {"id":"rafteryStatisticsSociology19502001","abstract":"Statistical methods have had a successful half-century in sociology, contributing to a greatly improved standard of scientific rigor in the discipline. I identify three overlapping postwar generations of statistical methods in sociology, based on the kinds of data they address. The first generation, which started in the late 1940s, deals with cross-tabulations and focuses on measures of association and log-linear models, perhaps the area of statistics to which sociology has contributed the most. The second generation, which began in the 1960s, deals with unit-level survey data and focuses on LISREL-type causal models and event-history analysis. The third generation, starting to emerge in the late 1980s, deals with data that do not fall easily into either of these categories, either because they have a different form, such as texts or narratives, or because dependence is a crucial aspect, as with spatial or social network data. There are many new challenges, and the area is ripe for statistical research; several major institutions have recently launched new initiatives in statistics and the social sciences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Raftery","given":"Adrian E."}],"citation-key":"rafteryStatisticsSociology19502001","container-title":"Sociological Methodology","DOI":"10/bt22jh","ISSN":"1467-9531","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-45","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Statistics In Sociology, 1950–2000: A Selective Review","title-short":"Statistics In Sociology, 1950–2000","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0081-1750.00088/abstract","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"wattsCommonSenseSociological2014","abstract":"Sociologists have long advocated a sociological approach to explanation by contrasting it with common sense. The argument of this article, however, is that sociologists rely on common sense more than they realize. Moreover, this unacknowledged reliance causes serious problems for their explanations of social action, that is, for why people do what they do. Many such explanations, it is argued, conflate understandability with causality in ways that are not valid by the standards of scientific explanation. It follows that if sociologists want their explanations to be scientifically valid, they must evaluate them specifically on those grounds—in particular, by forcing them to make predictions. In becoming more scientific, however, it is predicted that sociologists’ explanations will also become less satisfying from an intuitive, sense-making perspective. Even as novel sources of data and improved methods open exciting new directions for sociological research, therefore, sociologists will increasingly have to choose between unsatisfying scientific explanations and satisfying but unscientific stories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Watts","given":"Duncan J."}],"citation-key":"wattsCommonSenseSociological2014","container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","container-title-short":"American Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10/f62w7r","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,1]]},"page":"313-351","source":"JSTOR","title":"Common Sense and Sociological Explanations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/678271","volume":"120"}
