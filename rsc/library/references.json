  {"id":"cavaille:EducationAntiImmigrationAttitudes.2019","abstract":"Low levels of education are a powerful predictor of anti-immigration\n                                sentiment. However, there is little consensus on the interpretation\n                                of this correlation: is it causal or is it an artifact of selection\n                                bias? We address this question by exploiting six major compulsory\n                                schooling reforms in five Western European countries—Denmark,\n                                France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Sweden—that have\n                                recently experienced politically influential anti-immigration\n                                movements. On average, we find that compelling students to remain in\n                                secondary school for at least an additional year decreases\n                                anti-immigration attitudes later in life. Instrumental variable\n                                estimates demonstrate that, among such compliers, an additional year\n                                of secondary schooling substantially reduces the probability of\n                                opposing immigration, believing that immigration erodes a country’s\n                                quality of life, and feeling close to far-right anti-immigration\n                                parties. These results suggest that rising post-war educational\n                                attainment has mitigated the rise of anti-immigration movements.

  {"id":"essround9:EuropeanSocialSurvey.2019","abstract":"The European Social Survey (ESS) is an academically-driven multi-country survey, which has been administered in over 30 countries to date. Its three aims are, firstly – to monitor and interpret changing public attitudes and values within Europe and to investigate how they interact with Europe's changing institutions, secondly - to advance and consolidate improved methods of cross-national survey measurement in Europe and beyond, and thirdly - to develop a series of European social indicators, including attitudinal indicators. In the ninth round, the survey covers 19 countries and employs the most rigorous methodologies. From Round 7 it is funded by the Members, Observers and Guests of ESS European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ESS ERIC) who represent national governments. Participating countries directly fund the central coordination costs of the ESS ERIC, as well the costs of fieldwork and national coordination in their own country. The survey involves strict random probability sampling, a minimum target response rate of 70% and rigorous translation protocols. The hour-long face-to-face interview includes questions on a variety of core topics repeated from previous rounds of the survey and also two modules developed for Round 9 covering Justice and Fairness in Europe and the \"Timing of Life\" (the latter is a repeat of a module from Round 3).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,15]]},"author":[{"literal":"ESS Round 9"}],"citation-key":"essround9:EuropeanSocialSurvey.2019","DOI":"10/ghfg9n","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"publisher":"NSD - Norwegian Centre for Research Data","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"European Social Survey Round 9 Data (2018).

  {"id":"grimmer:MachineLearningSocial.2021","abstract":"Social scientists are now in an era of data abundance, and machine learning tools are increasingly used to extract meaning from data sets both massive and small. We explain how the inclusion of machine learning in the social sciences requires us to rethink not only applications of machine learning methods but also best practices in the social sciences. In contrast to the traditional tasks for machine learning in computer science and statistics, when machine learning is applied to social scientific data, it is used to discover new concepts, measure the prevalence of those concepts, assess causal effects, and make predictions. The abundance of data and resources facilitates the move away from a deductive social science to a more sequential, interactive, and ultimately inductive approach to inference. We explain how an agnostic approach to machine learning methods focused on the social science tasks facilitates progress across a wide range of questions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Grimmer","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Roberts","given":"Margaret E."},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Brandon M."}],"citation-key":"grimmer:MachineLearningSocial.2021","container-title":"Annual Review of Political Science","container-title-short":"Annu.

It is one of today's most rapidly growing technical fields, lying at the intersection of computer science and statistics, and at the core of artificial intelligence and data science. Recent progress in machine learning has been driven both by the development of new learning algorithms and theory and by the ongoing explosion in the availability of online data and low-cost computation. The adoption of data-intensive machine-learning methods can be found throughout science, technology and commerce, leading to more evidence-based decision-making across many walks of life, including health care, manufacturing, education, financial modeling, policing, and marketing.","author":[{"family":"Jordan","given":"M.
