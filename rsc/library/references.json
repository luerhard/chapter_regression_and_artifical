  {"id":"essround9:EuropeanSocialSurvey.2019","abstract":"The European Social Survey (ESS) is an academically-driven multi-country survey, which has been administered in over 30 countries to date. Its three aims are, firstly – to monitor and interpret changing public attitudes and values within Europe and to investigate how they interact with Europe's changing institutions, secondly - to advance and consolidate improved methods of cross-national survey measurement in Europe and beyond, and thirdly - to develop a series of European social indicators, including attitudinal indicators. In the ninth round, the survey covers 19 countries and employs the most rigorous methodologies. From Round 7 it is funded by the Members, Observers and Guests of ESS European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ESS ERIC) who represent national governments. Participating countries directly fund the central coordination costs of the ESS ERIC, as well the costs of fieldwork and national coordination in their own country. The survey involves strict random probability sampling, a minimum target response rate of 70% and rigorous translation protocols. The hour-long face-to-face interview includes questions on a variety of core topics repeated from previous rounds of the survey and also two modules developed for Round 9 covering Justice and Fairness in Europe and the \"Timing of Life\" (the latter is a repeat of a module from Round 3).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,15]]},"author":[{"literal":"ESS Round 9"}],"DOI":"10/ghfg9n","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"publisher":"NSD - Norwegian Centre for Research Data","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"European Social Survey Round 9 Data (2018).

  {"id":"jordan:MachineLearning.2015","abstract":"Machine learning addresses the question of how to build computers that improve automatically through experience. It is one of today's most rapidly growing technical fields, lying at the intersection of computer science and statistics, and at the core of artificial intelligence and data science. Recent progress in machine learning has been driven both by the development of new learning algorithms and theory and by the ongoing explosion in the availability of online data and low-cost computation. The adoption of data-intensive machine-learning methods can be found throughout science, technology and commerce, leading to more evidence-based decision-making across many walks of life, including health care, manufacturing, education, financial modeling, policing, and marketing.","author":[{"family":"Jordan","given":"M.

  {"id":"molina:MachineLearningSociology.2019","abstract":"Machine learning is a field at the intersection of statistics and computer science that uses algorithms to extract information and knowledge from data. Its applications increasingly find their way into economics, political science, and sociology. We offer a brief introduction to this vast toolbox and illustrate its current uses in the social sciences, including distilling measures from new data sources, such as text and images; characterizing population heterogeneity; improving causal inference; and offering predictions to aid policy decisions and theory development. We argue that, in addition to serving similar purposes in sociology, machine learning tools can speak to long-standing questions on the limitations of the linear modeling framework, the criteria for evaluating empirical findings, transparency around the context of discovery, and the epistemological core of the discipline.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Molina","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Garip","given":"Filiz"}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Sociology","container-title-short":"Annu.
