  {"id":"arikan:influencesocietalvalues.2013","abstract":"This paper examines the influence of societal values on individual attitudes towards immigration and immigrants. We argue that conflict between individual and societal values leads individuals to be exposed to frames and opinions that are contrary to their values, evokes competing considerations and creates attitudinal ambivalence and volatility. To evade ambivalence, individuals whose values are in conflict with those of their society rely less on their core values to construct their attitudes. Using data from the first wave of European Social Surveys and relying on Heteroskedastic Maximum Likelihood Regression, we test our argument simultaneously for 18 European countries and show that deviations from society’s conservation and self-transcendence values lead to greater ambivalence in attitudes towards immigration and immigrants. Our results provide evidence of the importance of the social context and society’s shared values in influencing personal political attitudes and judgments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Arikan","given":"Gizem"},{"family":"Ben-Nun Bloom","given":"Pazit"}],"citation-key":"arikan:influencesocietalvalues.2013","container-title":"International Political Science Review","container-title-short":"International Political Science Review","DOI":"10.1177/0192512111411210","ISSN":"0192-5121, 1460-373X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,3]]},"language":"en","page":"210-226","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The influence of societal values on attitudes towards immigration","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0192512111411210","volume":"34"},

However, there is little consensus on the interpretation\n                                of this correlation: is it causal or is it an artifact of selection\n                                bias? We address this question by exploiting six major compulsory\n                                schooling reforms in five Western European countries—Denmark,\n                                France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Sweden—that have\n                                recently experienced politically influential anti-immigration\n                                movements. On average, we find that compelling students to remain in\n                                secondary school for at least an additional year decreases\n                                anti-immigration attitudes later in life. Instrumental variable\n                                estimates demonstrate that, among such compliers, an additional year\n                                of secondary schooling substantially reduces the probability of\n                                opposing immigration, believing that immigration erodes a country’s\n                                quality of life, and feeling close to far-right anti-immigration\n                                parties.

  {"id":"degraveMagneticControlTokamak2022","abstract":"Nuclear fusion using magnetic confinement, in particular in the tokamak configuration, is a promising path towards sustainable energy. A core challenge is to shape and maintain a high-temperature plasma within the tokamak vessel. This requires high-dimensional, high-frequency, closed-loop control using magnetic actuator coils, further complicated by the diverse requirements across a wide range of plasma configurations. In this work, we introduce a previously undescribed architecture for tokamak magnetic controller design that autonomously learns to command the full set of control coils. This architecture meets control objectives specified at a high level, at the same time satisfying physical and operational constraints. This approach has unprecedented flexibility and generality in problem specification and yields a notable reduction in design effort to produce new plasma configurations. We successfully produce and control a diverse set of plasma configurations on the Tokamak à Configuration Variable1,2, including elongated, conventional shapes, as well as advanced configurations, such as negative triangularity and ‘snowflake’ configurations. Our approach achieves accurate tracking of the location, current and shape for these configurations. We also demonstrate sustained ‘droplets’ on TCV, in which two separate plasmas are maintained simultaneously within the vessel. This represents a notable advance for tokamak feedback control, showing the potential of reinforcement learning to accelerate research in the fusion domain, and is one of the most challenging real-world systems to which reinforcement learning has been applied.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Degrave","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Felici","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Buchli","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Neunert","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Tracey","given":"Brendan"},{"family":"Carpanese","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Ewalds","given":"Timo"},{"family":"Hafner","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Abdolmaleki","given":"Abbas"},{"family":"Casas","given":"Diego","non-dropping-particle":"de las"},{"family":"Donner","given":"Craig"},{"family":"Fritz","given":"Leslie"},{"family":"Galperti","given":"Cristian"},{"family":"Huber","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Keeling","given":"James"},{"family":"Tsimpoukelli","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Kay","given":"Jackie"},{"family":"Merle","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Moret","given":"Jean-Marc"},{"family":"Noury","given":"Seb"},{"family":"Pesamosca","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Pfau","given":"David"},{"family":"Sauter","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Sommariva","given":"Cristian"},{"family":"Coda","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Duval","given":"Basil"},{"family":"Fasoli","given":"Ambrogio"},{"family":"Kohli","given":"Pushmeet"},{"family":"Kavukcuoglu","given":"Koray"},{"family":"Hassabis","given":"Demis"},{"family":"Riedmiller","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"degraveMagneticControlTokamak2022","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-04301-9","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7897","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2]]},"language":"en","number":"7897","page":"414-419","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Magnetic control of tokamak plasmas through deep reinforcement learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04301-9","volume":"602"},
  {"id":"essround9:EuropeanSocialSurvey.2019","abstract":"The European Social Survey (ESS) is an academically-driven multi-country survey, which has been administered in over 30 countries to date. Its three aims are, firstly – to monitor and interpret changing public attitudes and values within Europe and to investigate how they interact with Europe's changing institutions, secondly - to advance and consolidate improved methods of cross-national survey measurement in Europe and beyond, and thirdly - to develop a series of European social indicators, including attitudinal indicators. In the ninth round, the survey covers 19 countries and employs the most rigorous methodologies. From Round 7 it is funded by the Members, Observers and Guests of ESS European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ESS ERIC) who represent national governments. Participating countries directly fund the central coordination costs of the ESS ERIC, as well the costs of fieldwork and national coordination in their own country. The survey involves strict random probability sampling, a minimum target response rate of 70% and rigorous translation protocols. The hour-long face-to-face interview includes questions on a variety of core topics repeated from previous rounds of the survey and also two modules developed for Round 9 covering Justice and Fairness in Europe and the \"Timing of Life\" (the latter is a repeat of a module from Round 3).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,15]]},"author":[{"literal":"ESS Round 9"}],"citation-key":"essround9:EuropeanSocialSurvey.2019","DOI":"10/ghfg9n","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"publisher":"NSD - Norwegian Centre for Research Data","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"European Social Survey Round 9 Data (2018).

We explain how the inclusion of machine learning in the social sciences requires us to rethink not only applications of machine learning methods but also best practices in the social sciences. In contrast to the traditional tasks for machine learning in computer science and statistics, when machine learning is applied to social scientific data, it is used to discover new concepts, measure the prevalence of those concepts, assess causal effects, and make predictions. The abundance of data and resources facilitates the move away from a deductive social science to a more sequential, interactive, and ultimately inductive approach to inference. We explain how an agnostic approach to machine learning methods focused on the social science tasks facilitates progress across a wide range of questions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Grimmer","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Roberts","given":"Margaret E."},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Brandon M."}],"citation-key":"grimmer:MachineLearningSocial.2021","container-title":"Annual Review of Political Science","container-title-short":"Annu.

Ongoing worldwide computerization has led to completely new opportunities for social scientists to conceive human interactions and relations in unknown precision and quantities. However, the large data sets require techniques that are more likely to be found in computer and natural sciences than in the established fields of social relations. In order to facilitate the participation of social scientists in an emerging interdisciplinary research branch of “computational social science,” we propose in this article the usage of the Python programming language. First, we carve out its capacity to handle “Big Data” in suitable formats. Second, we introduce programming libraries to analyze large networks and big text corpora, conduct simulations, and compare their performance to their counterparts in the R environment. Furthermore, we highlight practical tools implemented in Python for operational tasks like preparing presentations. Finally, we discuss how the process of writing code may help to exemplify theoretical concepts and could lead to empirical applications that gain a better understanding of the social processes initiated by the truly global connections of the Internet era.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Heiberger","given":"Raphael H."},{"family":"Riebling","given":"Jan R."}],"citation-key":"heibergerInstallingComputationalSocial2016","container-title":"Methodological Innovations","container-title-short":"Methodological Innovations","DOI":"10.1177/2059799115622763","ISSN":", 2059-7991","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-11","source":"mio.sagepub.com","title":"Installing computational social science: Facing the challenges of new information and communication technologies in social science","title-short":"Installing computational social science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://mio.sagepub.com/content/9/2059799115622763","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"molina:MachineLearningSociology.2019","abstract":"Machine learning is a field at the intersection of statistics and computer science that uses algorithms to extract information and knowledge from data. Its applications increasingly find their way into economics, political science, and sociology. We offer a brief introduction to this vast toolbox and illustrate its current uses in the social sciences, including distilling measures from new data sources, such as text and images; characterizing population heterogeneity; improving causal inference; and offering predictions to aid policy decisions and theory development. We argue that, in addition to serving similar purposes in sociology, machine learning tools can speak to long-standing questions on the limitations of the linear modeling framework, the criteria for evaluating empirical findings, transparency around the context of discovery, and the epistemological core of the discipline.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Molina","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Garip","given":"Filiz"}],"citation-key":"molina:MachineLearningSociology.2019","container-title":"Annual Review of Sociology","container-title-short":"Annu.

  {"id":"wattsCommonSenseSociological2014","abstract":"Sociologists have long advocated a sociological approach to explanation by contrasting it with common sense. The argument of this article, however, is that sociologists rely on common sense more than they realize. Moreover, this unacknowledged reliance causes serious problems for their explanations of social action, that is, for why people do what they do. Many such explanations, it is argued, conflate understandability with causality in ways that are not valid by the standards of scientific explanation. It follows that if sociologists want their explanations to be scientifically valid, they must evaluate them specifically on those grounds—in particular, by forcing them to make predictions. In becoming more scientific, however, it is predicted that sociologists’ explanations will also become less satisfying from an intuitive, sense-making perspective. Even as novel sources of data and improved methods open exciting new directions for sociological research, therefore, sociologists will increasingly have to choose between unsatisfying scientific explanations and satisfying but unscientific stories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Watts","given":"Duncan J."}],"citation-key":"wattsCommonSenseSociological2014","container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","container-title-short":"American Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1086/678271","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,1]]},"page":"313-351","source":"JSTOR","title":"Common Sense and Sociological Explanations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/678271","volume":"120"}
