  {"id":"abbasiCorrelationResearchPerformance2011","abstract":"In this study, we develop a theoretical model based on social network theory to understand how the collaboration (co-authorship) network of scholars correlates to the research performance of scholars. For this analysis, we use social network analysis (SNA) measures (i.e., normalized closeness centrality, normalized betweenness centrality, efficiency, and two types of degree centrality). The analysis of data shows that the research performance of scholars is positively correlated with two SNA measures (i.e., weighted degree centrality and efficiency). In particular, scholars with strong ties (i.e., repeated co-authorships, i.e., high weighted degree centrality) show a better research performance than those with low ties (e.g., single co-authorships with many different scholars). The results related to efficiency show that scholars, who maintain a strong co-authorship relationship to only one co-author of a group of linked co-authors (i.e., co-authors that have joined publications), perform better than those researchers with many relationships to the same group of linked co-authors.","author":[{"family":"Abbasi","given":"A."},{"family":"Altmann","given":"J."}],"citation-key":"abbasiCorrelationResearchPerformance2011","container-title":"2011 44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)","DOI":"10.1109/HICSS.2011.325","event":"2011 44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,1]]},"page":"1-10","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"On the Correlation between Research Performance and Social Network Analysis Measures Applied to Research Collaboration Networks","type":"paper-conference"},

Using structural holes theory, we focus on how a scholar’s egocentric network properties of density, efficiency and constraint within the network associate with their scholarly performance. For our analysis, we use publication data of high impact factor journals in the field of “Information Science &amp; Library Science” between 2000 and 2009, extracted from Scopus. The resulting database contained 4837 publications reflecting the contributions of 8069 authors. Results from our data analysis suggest that research performance of scholars’ is significantly correlated with scholars’ ego-network measures. In particular, scholars with more co-authors and those who exhibit higher levels of betweenness centrality (i.e., the extent to which a co-author is between another pair of co-authors) perform better in terms of research (i.e., higher g-index). Furthermore, scholars with efficient collaboration networks who maintain a strong co-authorship relationship with one primary co-author within a group of linked co-authors (i.e., co-authors that have joint publications) perform better than those researchers with many relationships to the same group of linked co-authors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Abbasi","given":"Alireza"},{"family":"Chung","given":"Kon Shing Kenneth"},{"family":"Hossain","given":"Liaquat"}],"citation-key":"abbasiEgocentricAnalysisCoauthorship2012","container-title":"Information Processing & Management","container-title-short":"Information Processing & Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.ipm.2011.09.001","ISSN":"0306-4573","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,7]]},"page":"671-679","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Egocentric analysis of co-authorship network structure, position and performance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457311000975","volume":"48"},

  {"id":"abbottChaosDisciplines2001","abstract":"In this vital new study, Andrew Abbott presents a fresh and daring analysis of the evolution and development of the social sciences. Chaos of Disciplines reconsiders how knowledge actually changes and advances. Challenging the accepted belief that social sciences are in a perpetual state of progress, Abbott contends that disciplines instead cycle around an inevitable pattern of core principles. New schools of thought, then, are less a reaction to an established order than they are a reinvention of fundamental concepts.Chaos of Disciplines uses fractals to explain the patterns of disciplines, and then applies them to key debates that surround the social sciences. Abbott argues that knowledge in different disciplines is organized by common oppositions that function at any level of theoretical or methodological scale. Opposing perspectives of thought and method, then, in fields ranging from history, sociology, and literature, are to the contrary, radically similar; much like fractals, they are each mutual reflections of their own distinctions.","author":[{"family":"Abbott","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"abbottChaosDisciplines2001","event-place":"Chicago","ISBN":"978-0-226-00100-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,2,15]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"286","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","publisher-place":"Chicago","source":"Google Books","title":"Chaos of Disciplines","type":"book"},
  {"id":"abbottDemographyScholarlyReading2016","abstract":"This paper argues that the demographic consequences of the ending of U. S. academic expansion in the 1970s virtually guaranteed a large decline in the total disciplinary effort available to read any given unit of sociological publication. These effects are partly composition effects related to shift from a pyramidal to a columnar age distribution and partly substitution effects related to the switch from a seller’s to a buyer’s market for academic talent. As buyers raised standards, publication expanded rapidly, which both increased the material to be read and decreased the time available to read it. The crisis in scholarly reading is less a result of changes in individual scholarly propensities to read than in the numbers and ages of scholars and of the newly central role of publication in scholarly careers. Since publication is now a system of excess, the paper closes with an analysis of the various strategies available to handle that excess.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Abbott","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"abbottDemographyScholarlyReading2016","container-title":"The American Sociologist","container-title-short":"Am Soc","DOI":"10.1007/s12108-016-9315-z","ISSN":"0003-1232, 1936-4784","issue":"2-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"302-318","source":"link.springer.com","title":"The Demography of Scholarly Reading","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12108-016-9315-z","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"aggarwalFinancialMarketsInstitutions2010","abstract":"While it is clear that some countries are bank oriented and others rely more on equity financing, there is little research on the degree to which the national architecture for financial intermediation is determined by legal, cultural, and other national characteristics. Using panel analysis of data for a recent eleven-year period for nineteen major European countries, this paper documents that the architecture of financial intermediation is influenced by national cultural, political, and economic factors. Specifically, we provide robust evidence that a greater predilection for market financing over bank financing is associated with higher levels of power distance, concentration in equity markets, control of corruption, efficiency of debt enforcement; and the adoption of the euro. Lower predilection for equity financing is associated with an English legal origin, greater uncertainty avoidance, and greater political legitimacy. Our results should be of great interest to managers and policy makers and to scholars interested in the relationship of culture, political economy, and financial intermediation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Aggarwal","given":"Raj"},{"family":"Goodell","given":"John W."}],"citation-key":"aggarwalFinancialMarketsInstitutions2010","container-title":"International Business Review","container-title-short":"International Business Review","DOI":"10.1016/j.ibusrev.2009.07.010","ISSN":"0969-5931","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,10]]},"page":"502-520","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Financial markets versus institutions in European countries: Influence of culture and other national characteristics","title-short":"Financial markets versus institutions in European countries","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969593109001000","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"aguinisCustomerCentricScienceReporting2010","abstract":"In response to the ongoing concern regarding a science-practice gap, we propose a customer-centric approach to reporting significant research results that involves a sequence of three interdependent steps. The first step involves setting an alpha level (i.e., a priori Type I error rate) that considers the relative seriousness of falsely rejecting a null hypothesis of no effect or relationship (i.e., Type I error) relative to not detecting an existing effect or relationship (i.e., Type II error) and reporting the actual observed p value (i.e., probability that the data would be obtained if the null hypothesis is true). The second step involves reporting estimates of the size of the effect or relationship, which indicate the extent to which an outcome is explained or predicted. The third step includes reporting results of a qualitative study to gather evidence regarding the practical significance of the effect or relationship. Our proposal to report research results with rigor, relevance, and practical impact involves important changes in how we report research results with the goal to bridge the science-practice gap.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Aguinis","given":"Herman"},{"family":"Werner","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Lanza Abbott","given":"JéAnna"},{"family":"Angert","given":"Cory"},{"family":"Park","given":"Joon Hyung"},{"family":"Kohlhausen","given":"Donna"}],"citation-key":"aguinisCustomerCentricScienceReporting2010","container-title":"Organizational Research Methods","container-title-short":"Organizational Research Methods","DOI":"10.1177/1094428109333339","ISSN":"1094-4281","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"515-539","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Customer-Centric Science: Reporting Significant Research Results With Rigor, Relevance, and Practical Impact in Mind","title-short":"Customer-Centric Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428109333339","volume":"13"},

To explain this finding, I argue that stocks in more central industries have greater market risk because they have greater exposure to sectoral shocks that transmit from one industry to another through intersectoral trade.  Consistent with this argument, stock returns of central industries covary more closely with market returns and future consumption growth.  In addition, the empirical evidence suggests that sectoral shocks that contribute to aggregate risk are more likely to pass through central industries than peripheral industries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahern","given":"Kenneth R."}],"citation-key":"ahernNetworkCentralityCross2013","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,1]]},"number":"ID 2197370","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Network Centrality and the Cross Section of Stock Returns","type":"report","URL":"http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2197370"},

Less discussed is the role of typologies in evaluating and revising theoretical arguments. We argue that unsupervised machine learning tools can be profitably applied to the development and testing of theory-based typologies. We review recent advances in mixture models as applied to cluster analysis and argue that these tools are particularly important in the social sciences where it is common to claim that high-dimensional objects group together in meaningful clusters. Model-based clustering (MBC) grounds analysis in probability theory, permitting the evaluation of uncertainty and application of information-based model selection tools. We show that the MBC approach forces analysts to consider dimensionality problems that more traditional clustering tools obscure. We apply MBC to the “varieties of capitalism,” a typology receiving significant attention in political science and economic sociology. We find weak and conflicting evidence for the theory's expected grouping. We therefore caution against the current practice of including typology-derived dummy variables in regression and case-comparison research designs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahlquist","given":"John S."},{"family":"Breunig","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"ahlquistModelbasedClusteringTypologies2012a","container-title":"Political Analysis","DOI":"10.1093/pan/mpr039","ISSN":"1047-1987, 1476-4989","issue":"1","issued":{"literal":"2012/ed"},"language":"en","page":"92-112","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Model-based Clustering and Typologies in the Social Sciences","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/modelbased-clustering-and-typologies-in-the-social-sciences/91755A99514C1E30F97426CCB6147A5D","volume":"20"},

The paper suggests that partly, qualitative research emerged because some of the articles formerly classified as ‘non‐empirical’ or ‘theoretical’ gave way to an increasing share of articles classified as qualitative. In addition, the rise of qualitative inquiry meant that the everyday reality which produces statistical relationships between the variables of quantitative analysis is given more attention. Since the rise of qualitative research has primarily taken place at the expense of non‐empirical or theoretical rather than quantitative articles, one can argue that it has contributed to an overall systematization of social research.

Although previous work has been done studying the content of Trump’s tweets, there remains a dearth of research exploring who opinion leaders were in the early days of his presidency and what they were tweeting about. Therefore, this study retroactively investigates opinion leaders on Twitter during Trump’s 1st month in office and explores what those influencers tweeted about. We uniquely used a historical data set of 3 million tweets that contained the word “trump” and used Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a probabilistic algorithmic model, to extract topics from both general Twitter users and opinion leaders. Opinion leaders were identified by measuring eigenvector centrality and removing users with fewer than 10,000 followers. The top 1% users with the highest score in eigencentrality (N = 303) were sampled, and their attributes were manually coded. We found that most Twitter-based opinion leaders are either media outlets/journalists with a left-center bias or social bots. Immigration was found to be a key topic during our study period.

These comparisons show that, within the varieties of capitalism approach, actors' strategic preferences are assumed to be endogenous to the institutional environment in which they operate. Moreover, important institutions are assumed to be uniformly spread across firms within a national economy. This latter presupposition ultimately makes the varieties of capitalism framework a structuralist approach. Despite its claims to the contrary that it is an actor-centred approach, the varieties of firms paradigm treats the varieties of firms as irrelevant. It is this variety that is lacking in the approach, and that needs to be addressed in any empirical assessments of it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Allen","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"allenVarietiesCapitalismParadigm2004","container-title":"Socio-Economic Review","container-title-short":"Socioecon Rev","DOI":"10.1093/soceco/2.1.87","ISSN":"1475-1461, 1475-147X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"87-108","source":"ser.oxfordjournals.org","title":"The varieties of capitalism paradigm: not enough variety?","title-short":"The varieties of capitalism paradigm","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ser.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/1/87","volume":"2"},

The findings show a strong belief in the selfish rich inequality hypothesis at the global level; in the majority of countries, the mode is to strongly agree with it. However, we also identify important between- and within-country variation. We find that the belief in selfish rich inequality is much stronger in countries with extensive corruption and weak institutions and less strong among people who are higher in the income distribution in their society. Finally, we show that the belief in selfish rich inequality is predictive of people’s policy views on inequality and redistribution: It is significantly positively associated with agreeing that inequality in their country is unfair, and it is significantly positively associated with agreeing that the government should aim to reduce inequality. These relationships are highly significant both across and within countries and robust to including country-level or individual-level controls and using Lasso-selected regressors. Thus, the data provide compelling evidence of people believing that the rich are richer because they have been more selfish in life and perceiving selfish behavior as creating unfair inequality and justifying equalizing policies.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Almås","given":"Ingvild"},{"family":"Cappelen","given":"Alexander W."},{"family":"Sørensen","given":"Erik Ø"},{"family":"Tungodden","given":"Bertil"}],"citation-key":"almasGlobalEvidenceSelfish2022","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2109690119","ISBN":"9782109690115","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,18]]},"language":"en","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Social Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Global evidence on the selfish rich inequality hypothesis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/119/3/e2109690119","volume":"119"},

This paper presents the first automated unsupervised analysis of LDA models to identify junk topics from legitimate ones, and to rank the topic significance. Basically, the distance between a topic distribution and three definitions of “junk distribution” is computed using a variety of measures, from which an expressive figure of the topic significance is implemented using 4-phase Weighted Combination approach.

Our method, which is based on the belief propagation algorithm, is efficient, naturally distributed, and exact on trees. As a particular case, we consider the problem of finding the “zero patient” of a susceptible-infected-recovered or susceptible-infected epidemic given a snapshot of the state of the network at a later unknown time.

Financialization of French non-financial corporations has increased their dependence on earnings through financial channels, and diminished labor bargaining power in income distribution. We examine the effects of these financial revenues on wage share using a panel data model of 6980 French non-financial firms. We conclude that increased dependence on financial profits is likely to decrease wage share in non-financial corporations. Moreover, this variable is more influential in our model than the other variables usually identified by the literature as determinants of functional income distribution, such as trade openness or labor market institutions.

  {"id":"amancioStructureSemanticsInterplay2012","abstract":"The classification of texts has become a major endeavor with so much electronic material available, for it is an essential task in several applications, including search engines and information retrieval. There are different ways to define similarity for grouping similar texts into clusters, as the concept of similarity may depend on the purpose of the task. For instance, in topic extraction similar texts mean those within the same semantic field, whereas in author recognition stylistic features should be considered. In this study, we introduce ways to classify texts employing concepts of complex networks, which may be able to capture syntactic, semantic and even pragmatic features. The interplay between various metrics of the complex networks is analyzed with three applications, namely identification of machine translation (MT) systems, evaluation of quality of machine translated texts and authorship recognition. We shall show that topological features of the networks representing texts can enhance the ability to identify MT systems in particular cases. For evaluating the quality of MT texts, on the other hand, high correlation was obtained with methods capable of capturing the semantics. This was expected because the golden standards used are themselves based on word co-occurrence. Notwithstanding, the Katz similarity, which involves semantic and structure in the comparison of texts, achieved the highest correlation with the NIST measurement, indicating that in some cases the combination of both approaches can improve the ability to quantify quality in MT. In authorship recognition, again the topological features were relevant in some contexts, though for the books and authors analyzed good results were obtained with semantic features as well. Because hybrid approaches encompassing semantic and topological features have not been extensively used, we believe that the methodology proposed here may be useful to enhance text classification considerably, as it combines well-established strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Amancio","given":"Diego R."},{"family":"Oliveira Jr.","given":"Osvaldo N."},{"family":"Costa","given":"Luciano da F."}],"citation-key":"amancioStructureSemanticsInterplay2012","container-title":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","container-title-short":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","DOI":"10.1016/j.physa.2012.04.011","ISSN":"0378-4371","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9,15]]},"page":"4406-4419","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Structure–semantics interplay in complex networks and its effects on the predictability of similarity in texts","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437112003044","volume":"391"},

The IMF for example in its yearly 2009 Global Financial Stability Report acknowledged the lack of proper tools and research on the topic. Understanding how disruptions can propagate across financial markets is therefore of utmost importance.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nHere, we use empirical data to show that the world's markets have a non-linear threshold response to events, consistent with the hypothesis that traders exhibit change blindness. Change blindness is the tendency of humans to ignore small changes and to react disproportionately to large events. As we show, this may be responsible for generating cascading events—pricequakes—in the world's markets. We propose a network model of the world's stock exchanges that predicts how an individual stock exchange should be priced in terms of the performance of the global market of exchanges, but with change blindness included in the pricing. The model has a direct correspondence to models of earth tectonic plate movements developed in physics to describe the slip-stick movement of blocks linked via spring forces.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nWe have shown how the price dynamics of the world's stock exchanges follows a dynamics of build-up and release of stress, similar to earthquakes. The nonlinear response allows us to classify price movements of a given stock index as either being generated internally, due to specific economic news for the country in question, or externally, by the ensemble of the world's stock exchanges reacting together like a complex system. The model may provide new insight into the origins and thereby also prevent systemic risks in the global financial network.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Andersen","given":"Jørgen Vitting"},{"family":"Nowak","given":"Andrzej"},{"family":"Rotundo","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Parrott","given":"Lael"},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Sebastian"}],"citation-key":"andersenPriceQuakesShakingWorld2011","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0026472","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,11,2]]},"page":"e26472","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"“Price-Quakes” Shaking the World's Stock Exchanges","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0026472","volume":"6"},

Behavioral economics, which recently emerged as a bona fide subdiscipline of economics, raises a number of questions of a philosophical, methodological, and historical nature. This chapter offers a survey of behavioral economics, including its historical origins, results, and methods; its relationship to neighboring fields; and its philosophical and methodological underpinnings. Our central thesis is that the development of behavioral economics in important respects parallels the development of cognitive science. Both fields are based on a repudiation of the positivist methodological strictures that were in place at their founding and a belief in the legitimacy of making reference to unobservable entities such as beliefs, emotions, and heuristics. And both fields adopt an interdisciplinary approach, admitting evidence of many kinds and using a variety of methods to generate such evidence. Moreover, there are in fact more direct links between the two fields. The single most important source of inspiration for behavioral economists has been behavioral decision research, which can in turn be seen as an integration of ideas from cognitive science and economics.

  {"id":"antonsContentContributionKnowledge2018","abstract":"Knowledge production and scientific discourse are observable in published scholarly texts. Citations capture knowledge consumption and impact. Drawing from the sociology of science, our theoretical framework posits scientific communities as thought collectives with distinctive thought styles that embed a hidden topic structure and rhetorical signals into a journal’s published articles. We hypothesize and uncover how an article’s topic attributes (structure, focus, and newness) and rhetorical attributes (inclusiveness, exclusiveness, tentativeness, and certainty) are related to future knowledge consumption. We empirically test our ideas by applying text mining algorithms to model topics and extract rhetorical signals from 1,646 strategy articles composed of nearly 18 million words generating 172,237 citations over 35 years. We find that strategy articles’ hidden topic structure explains 14% of variance in scientific impact. We also show that topic focus and topic newness each independently, directly, and significantly increase impact. As for newness, the first two articles published on a new topic each generate a citation premium >100%, which is higher within the focal thought collective than outside. Importantly, we find that the citation premium of newness increases with greater topic focus (which attracts attention) and greater inflow of prior intracollective knowledge (which enhances absorption). Impact also increases when authors present new topics using a rhetorical style that is more tentative than certain. Overall, our findings demonstrate that topic and rhetorical attributes, as constitutive elements of scientific content, are independently and interdependently related to the consumption of strategy articles across thought collectives in management research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Antons","given":"David"},{"family":"Joshi","given":"Amol M."},{"family":"Salge","given":"Torsten Oliver"}],"citation-key":"antonsContentContributionKnowledge2018","container-title":"Journal of Management","container-title-short":"Journal of Management","DOI":"10.1177/0149206318774619","ISSN":"0149-2063","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,4]]},"language":"en","page":"0149206318774619","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Content, Contribution, and Knowledge Consumption: Uncovering Hidden Topic Structure and Rhetorical Signals in Scientific Texts","title-short":"Content, Contribution, and Knowledge Consumption","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0149206318774619"},

We present a method that uses in vivo randomized experimentation to identify influence and susceptibility in networks while avoiding the biases inherent in traditional estimates of social contagion. Estimation in a representative sample of 1.3 million Facebook users showed that younger users are more susceptible to influence than older users, men are more influential than women, women influence men more than they influence other women, and married individuals are the least susceptible to influence in the decision to adopt the product offered. Analysis of influence and susceptibility together with network structure revealed that influential individuals are less susceptible to influence than noninfluential individuals and that they cluster in the network while susceptible individuals do not, which suggests that influential people with influential friends may be instrumental in the spread of this product in the network.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Aral","given":"Sinan"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Dylan"}],"citation-key":"aralIdentifyingInfluentialSusceptible2012","container-title":"Science","container-title-short":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.1215842","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6092","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,7,20]]},"language":"en","page":"337-341","PMID":"22722253","source":"www.sciencemag.org","title":"Identifying Influential and Susceptible Members of Social Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/337/6092/337","volume":"337"},

We apply two causal estimation schemes to cross-border collaboration data extracted from millions of academic publications from 1996 to 2012, which are disaggregated across 14 subject areas and 32 European countries. Our results illustrate the unintended consequences following the 2004/2007 enlargement, namely, its negative impact on cross-border collaboration in science. First, we use the synthetic control method to show that levels of European cross-border collaboration would have been higher without EU enlargement, despite the 2004/2007 EU entrants gaining access to EU resources incentivizing cross-border integration. Second, we implement a difference-in-difference panel regression, incorporating official intra-European high-skilled mobility statistics, to identify migration imbalance—principally from entrant to incumbent EU member states—as a major factor underlying the divergence in cross-border integration between Western and Eastern Europe. These results challenge central tenets underlying ERA integration policies that unifying labor markets will increase the international competitiveness of the ERA, thereby calling attention to the need for effective home-return incentives and policies.\nCounterintuitively, by joining the European Union, scientific collaboration in entrant countries became less international.\nCounterintuitively, by joining the European Union, scientific collaboration in entrant countries became less international.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Arrieta","given":"Omar A.

  {"id":"askinWhatMakesPopular2017","abstract":"In this article, we propose a new explanation for why certain cultural products outperform their peers to achieve widespread success. We argue that products’ position in feature space significantly predicts their popular success. Using tools from computer science, we construct a novel dataset allowing us to examine whether the musical features of nearly 27,000 songs from Billboard’s Hot 100 charts predict their levels of success in this cultural market. We find that, in addition to artist familiarity, genre affiliation, and institutional support, a song’s perceived proximity to its peers influences its position on the charts. Contrary to the claim that all popular music sounds the same, we find that songs sounding too much like previous and contemporaneous productions—those that are highly typical—are less likely to succeed. Songs exhibiting some degree of optimal differentiation are more likely to rise to the top of the charts. These findings offer a new perspective on success in cultural markets by specifying how content organizes product competition and audience consumption behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Askin","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Mauskapf","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"askinWhatMakesPopular2017","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/0003122417728662","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"910-944","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"What Makes Popular Culture Popular?

Because empirical observations are inevitably mediated by theoretical preconceptions, our knowledge of organizations is fundamentally shaped by the subjective world views through which we perceive data.

The chief product of research is, consequently, theoretical language, rather than objective data.

  {"id":"auSociologyScienceMaking2017","abstract":"Criticism against quantitative methods has grown in the context of “big-data”, charging an empirical, quantitative agenda with expanding to displace qualitative and theoretical approaches indispensable to the future of sociological research. Underscoring the strong convergences between the historical development of empiricism in the scientific method and the apparent turn to quantitative empiricism in sociology, this article uses content and hierarchical clustering analyses on the textual representations of journal articles from 1950 to 2010 to open dialogue on the epistemological issues of contemporary sociological research. In doing so, I push towards the conceptualization of a social scientific method, inspired by the scientific method from the philosophy of science and borne out of growing constructions of a systematically empirical representation among sociology articles. I articulate how this social scientific method is defined by three dimensions – empiricism, and theoretical and discursive compartmentalization –, and how, contrary to popular expectations, knowledge production consequently becomes independent of choice of research method, bound up instead in social constructions that divide its epistemological occurrence into two levels: (i) the way in which social reality is broken down into data, collected and analyzed, and (ii) the way in which this data is framed and made to recursively influence future sociological knowledge production. In this way, empiricism both mediates and is mediated by knowledge production not through the direct manipulation of method or theory use, but by redefining the ways in which methods are being labeled and knowledge framed, remembered, and interpreted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Au","given":"Anson"}],"citation-key":"auSociologyScienceMaking2017","container-title":"The American Sociologist","container-title-short":"Am Soc","DOI":"10.1007/s12108-017-9348-y","ISSN":"0003-1232, 1936-4784","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,10]]},"language":"en","page":"1-18","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Sociology and Science: The Making of a Social Scientific Method","title-short":"Sociology and Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12108-017-9348-y"},

If the trends over the past 20 years continue to hold in the future, then the Zipf ranking approach leads to the prediction that in about 50 years, all countries participating in globalization will have comparable values of their MCAP per capita.

  {"id":"backWhoGetsWhat2011","abstract":"Ministerial portfolios are the most obvious payoffs for parties entering a governing coalition in parliamentary democracies. This renders the bargaining over portfolios an important phase of the government formation process. The question of ‘who gets what, and why?’ in terms of ministerial remits has not yet received much attention by coalition or party scholars. This article focuses on this qualitative aspect of portfolio allocation and uses a new comparative dataset to evaluate a number of hypotheses that can be drawn from the literature. The main hypothesis is that parties which, in their election manifestos, emphasise themes corresponding to the policy remit of specific cabinet portfolios are more likely to obtain control over these portfolios. The results show that policy saliency is indeed an important predictor of portfolio allocation in postwar Western European parliamentary democracies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Bäck","given":"Hanna"},{"family":"Debus","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Dumont","given":"Patrick"}],"citation-key":"backWhoGetsWhat2011","container-title":"European Journal of Political Research","DOI":"10.1111/j.1475-6765.2010.01980.x","ISSN":"1475-6765","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"441-478","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Who gets what in coalition governments?

We argue that rational and emotional styles of communication ebb and flow within public discussions about social problems due to the alternating influence of social contagion and saturation effects. These “cognitive-emotional currents” create an opportunity structure whereby advocacy organizations stimulate more conversation if they produce emotional messages after prolonged rational debate or vice versa. We test this hypothesis using automated text-analysis techniques that measure the frequency of cognitive and emotional language within two advocacy fields on Facebook over 1.5 years, and a web-based application that offered these organizations a complimentary audit of their social media outreach in return for sharing nonpublic data about themselves, their social media audiences, and the broader social context in which they interact. Time-series models reveal strong support for our hypothesis, controlling for 33 confounding factors measured by our Facebook application.

However, social scientists have not explained why some advocacy organizations produce social media messages that inspire far-ranging conversation among social media users, whereas the vast majority of them receive little or no attention. I argue that advocacy organizations are more likely to inspire comments from new social media audiences if they create “cultural bridges,” or produce messages that combine conversational themes within an advocacy field that are seldom discussed together. I use natural language processing, network analysis, and a social media application to analyze how cultural bridges shaped public discourse about autism spectrum disorders on Facebook over the course of 1.5 years, controlling for various characteristics of advocacy organizations, their social media audiences, and the broader social context in which they interact. I show that organizations that create substantial cultural bridges provoke 2.52 times more comments about their messages from new social media users than those that do not, controlling for these factors.

  {"id":"bailCulturalCarryingCapacity2016","abstract":"Social media sites such as Facebook have become a powerful tool for public health outreach because they enable advocacy organizations to influence the rapidly increasing number of people who frequent these forums. Yet the very open-ness of social media sites creates fierce competition for public attention. The vast majority of social media messages provoke little or no reaction because of the sheer volume of information that confronts the typical social media user each day. In this article, I present a theory of the “cultural carrying capacity” of social media messaging campaigns. I argue that advocacy organizations inspire more endorsements, comments, and shares by social media users if they diversify the discursive content of their messages. Yet too much diversification creates large, disconnected audiences that lack the sense of shared purpose necessary to sustain an online movement. To evaluate this theory, I created a Facebook application that collects social media posts produced by forty-two organ donation advocacy organizations over 1.5 years, as well as supplemental information about the organization, its audience, and the broader social context in which they interact. Time series models provide strong evidence for my theory net of demographic characteristics of social media users, the resources and tactics of each organization, and broader external factors.

  {"id":"bailCulturalEnvironmentMeasuring2014","abstract":"The rise of the Internet, social media, and digitized historical archives has produced a colossal amount of text-based data in recent years. While computer scientists have produced powerful new tools for automated analyses of such “big data,” they lack the theoretical direction necessary to extract meaning from them. Meanwhile, cultural sociologists have produced sophisticated theories of the social origins of meaning, but lack the methodological capacity to explore them beyond micro-levels of analysis. I propose a synthesis of these two fields that adjoins conventional qualitative methods and new techniques for automated analysis of large amounts of text in iterative fashion. First, I explain how automated text extraction methods may be used to map the contours of cultural environments. Second, I discuss the potential of automated text-classification methods to classify different types of culture such as frames, schema, or symbolic boundaries. Finally, I explain how these new tools can be combined with conventional qualitative methods to trace the evolution of such cultural elements over time. While my assessment of the integration of big data and cultural sociology is optimistic, my conclusion highlights several challenges in implementing this agenda. These include a lack of information about the social context in which texts are produced, the construction of reliable coding schemes that can be automated algorithmically, and the relatively high entry costs for cultural sociologists who wish to develop the technical expertise currently necessary to work with big data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bail","given":"Christopher A."}],"citation-key":"bailCulturalEnvironmentMeasuring2014","container-title":"Theory and Society","container-title-short":"Theor Soc","DOI":"10.1007/s11186-014-9216-5","ISSN":"0304-2421, 1573-7853","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"465-482","source":"link.springer.com","title":"The cultural environment: measuring culture with big data","title-short":"The cultural environment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11186-014-9216-5","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"bailFringeEffectCivil2012","abstract":"Numerous studies indicate that civil society organizations create cultural change by deploying mainstream messages that resonate with prevailing discursive themes. Yet these case studies of highly influential organizations obscure the much larger population that have little or no impact. It is therefore unclear whether civil society organizations create cultural change by deploying mainstream discourses or if they become part of the mainstream because of their success. I present an evolutionary theory of how discursive fields settle after major historical ruptures that highlights framing, social networks, and emotional energy. To illustrate this theory, I use plagiarism detection software to compare 1,084 press releases about Muslims produced by 120 civil society organizations to 50,407 newspaper articles and television transcripts produced between 2001 and 2008. Although most organizations deployed pro-Muslim discourses after the September 11th attacks, I show that anti-Muslim fringe organizations dominated the mass media via displays of fear and anger. Institutional amplification of this emotional energy, I argue, created a gravitational pull or “fringe effect” that realigned inter-organizational networks and altered the contours of mainstream discourse itself.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Bail","given":"Christopher A."}],"citation-key":"bailFringeEffectCivil2012","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.1177/0003122412465743","ISSN":"0003-1224, 1939-8271","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"855-879","source":"asr.sagepub.com","title":"The Fringe Effect Civil Society Organizations and the Evolution of Media Discourse about Islam since the September 11th Attacks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://asr.sagepub.com/content/77/6/855","volume":"77"},

Disruptions to the seasonal transmission patterns of these diseases may have consequences for the timing and severity of future outbreaks. Here we consider the implications of SARS-CoV-2 NPIs for two endemic infections circulating in the United States of America: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and seasonal influenza. Using laboratory surveillance data from 2020, we estimate that RSV transmission declined by at least 20% in the United States at the start of the NPI period. We simulate future trajectories of both RSV and influenza, using an epidemic model. As susceptibility increases over the NPI period, we find that substantial outbreaks of RSV may occur in future years, with peak outbreaks likely occurring in the winter of 2021–2022. Longer NPIs, in general, lead to larger future outbreaks although they may display complex interactions with baseline seasonality. Results for influenza broadly echo this picture, but are more uncertain; future outbreaks are likely dependent on the transmissibility and evolutionary dynamics of circulating strains.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Baker","given":"Rachel E."},{"family":"Park","given":"Sang Woo"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Wenchang"},{"family":"Vecchi","given":"Gabriel A."},{"family":"Metcalf","given":"C.

I examine the intellectual trajectory of the new economic sociology to highlight the role of academic familism, disciplinary spillover prestige, and gender for privileging the networks perspective, over other intellectual currents, in the early developments of the subfield. First, academic familism in a form of cross generational mentor-mentee relationships reinforced networks-based research among early champions of the new economic sociology, such as Harrison White and Mark Granovetter and their students. Second, the network perspective thrived on spillover prestige from natural sciences, which also embraced the study of networks, as well as from economics. Third, alignment with methodological and gender hierarchies in the discipline of sociology privileged the quantitative male-led network analyses over other approaches, such as cultural or inequality analysis. Providing an interpretation of the history of economic sociology, this article also reveals the mechanisms that stall gender integration within sociological subfields despite broader trends in feminization of our discipline.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Bandelj","given":"Nina"}],"citation-key":"bandeljAcademicFamilismSpillover2019","container-title":"The American Sociologist","container-title-short":"Am Soc","DOI":"10.1007/s12108-019-09421-4","ISSN":"1936-4784","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"488-508","source":"Springer Link","title":"Academic Familism, Spillover Prestige and Gender Segregation in Sociology Subfields: The Trajectory of Economic Sociology","title-short":"Academic Familism, Spillover Prestige and Gender Segregation in Sociology Subfields","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12108-019-09421-4","volume":"50"},

Moreover, we find evidence that an increase in search volume is associated with temporarily higher future returns, which reinforces our previous finding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Bank","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Larch","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Peter","given":"Georg"}],"citation-key":"bank_google_2011","container-title":"Financial Markets and Portfolio Management","container-title-short":"Financ Mark Portf Manag","DOI":"10.1007/s11408-011-0165-y","ISSN":"1555-4961, 1555-497X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7,9]]},"language":"en","page":"239-264","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Google search volume and its influence on liquidity and returns of German stocks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11408-011-0165-y","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"bankstoniiiSocialCapitalProcess2002","abstract":"In this study, we suggest that the difficulty in defining, locating, and measuring social capital is at core a philosophical confusion of language, and not just a consequence of excessively wide application. The term “capital” refers to resources for investment. Financial capital consists of specific quantities of assets. Human capital, a metaphorical extension of financial capital, also consists of specific quantities of assets, in the form of skills or credentials. However, social capital, a third metaphorical construction, does not consist of resources that are held by individuals or by groups but of processes of social interaction leading to constructive outcomes. Therefore, we argue, social capital is not located at any one level of analysis: it emerges across levels of analysis. The confusion over the meaning of this term, then, is a consequence of a metaphorical confusion of a substantive quantity (capital) and a process that takes place through stages (embedded, goal-directed social relations). Locating and defining social capital is further complicated by the variability, contextuality, and conditionality of the process. Stages of social relations that lead to constructive outcomes for one group of people or in one situation may not lead to constructive outcomes for another group or in another situation. To illustrate empirically how social capital may be thought of as a process consisting of stages and to demonstrate why the concept is inherently problematic, we employ data from the 1995 interviews of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). These data enable us to examine connections among the stages of the social capital process found in the literature and to look at predictors of academic achievement, a central topic in research on this topic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Bankston III","given":"Carl L."},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Min"}],"citation-key":"bankstoniiiSocialCapitalProcess2002","container-title":"Sociological Inquiry","DOI":"10.1111/1475-682X.00017","ISSN":"1475-682X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1475-682X.00017","page":"285-317","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Social Capital as Process: The Meanings and Problems of a Theoretical Metaphor","title-short":"Social Capital as Process","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-682X.00017","volume":"72"},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution.

In addition, it offers one of the most extensive database to date on social networks. By mapping the electronic database containing all relevant journals in mathematics and neuro-science for an 8-year period (1991–98), we infer the dynamic and the structural mechanisms that govern the evolution and topology of this complex system. Three complementary approaches allow us to obtain a detailed characterization. First, empirical measurements allow us to uncover the topological measures that characterize the network at a given moment, as well as the time evolution of these quantities. The results indicate that the network is scale-free, and that the network evolution is governed by preferential attachment, affecting both internal and external links. However, in contrast with most model predictions the average degree increases in time, and the node separation decreases. Second, we propose a simple model that captures the network's time evolution. In some limits the model can be solved analytically, predicting a two-regime scaling in agreement with the measurements. Third, numerical simulations are used to uncover the behavior of quantities that could not be predicted analytically. The combined numerical and analytical results underline the important role internal links play in determining the observed scaling behavior and network topology. The results and methodologies developed in the context of the co-authorship network could be useful for a systematic study of other complex evolving networks as well, such as the world wide web, Internet, or other social networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Barabási","given":"A.

Here, we provide a guide to help researchers navigate the consequential decisions they need to make before any measure can be produced from the text. We consider, both theoretically and empirically, the effects of such choices using as a running example efforts to measure the tone of New York Times coverage of the economy. We show that two reasonable approaches to corpus selection yield radically different corpora and we advocate for the use of keyword searches rather than predefined subject categories provided by news archives. We demonstrate the benefits of coding using article segments instead of sentences as units of analysis. We show that, given a fixed number of codings, it is better to increase the number of unique documents coded rather than the number of coders for each document. Finally, we find that supervised machine learning algorithms outperform dictionaries on a number of criteria. Overall, we intend this guide to serve as a reminder to analysts that thoughtfulness and human validation are key to text-as-data methods, particularly in an age when it is all too easy to computationally classify texts without attending to the methodological choices therein.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Barberá","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Boydstun","given":"Amber E."},{"family":"Linn","given":"Suzanna"},{"family":"McMahon","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Nagler","given":"Jonathan"}],"citation-key":"barberaAutomatedTextClassification2021","container-title":"Political Analysis","DOI":"10.1017/pan.2020.8","ISSN":"1047-1987, 1476-4989","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1]]},"language":"en","page":"19-42","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Automated Text Classification of News Articles: A Practical Guide","title-short":"Automated Text Classification of News Articles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/automated-text-classification-of-news-articles-a-practical-guide/10462DB284B1CD80C0FAE796AD786BC6","volume":"29"},

These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Barrat","given":"A."},{"family":"Barthélemy","given":"M."},{"family":"Pastor-Satorras","given":"R."},{"family":"Vespignani","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"barratArchitectureComplexWeighted2004","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0400087101","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,3,16]]},"language":"en","page":"3747-3752","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"The Architecture of Complex Weighted Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/101/11/3747","volume":"101"},
  {"id":"barronIndividualsInstitutionsInnovation2018","abstract":"The French Revolution brought principles of “liberty, equality, fraternity” to bear on the day-to-day challenges of governing what was then the largest country in Europe. Its experiments provided a model for future revolutions and democracies across the globe, but this first modern revolution had no model to follow. Using reconstructed transcripts of debates held in the Revolution’s first parliament, we present a quantitative analysis of how this body managed innovation. We use information theory to track the creation, transmission, and destruction of word-use patterns across over 40,000 speeches and a thousand speakers. The parliament as a whole was biased toward the adoption of new patterns, but speakers’ individual qualities could break these overall trends. Speakers on the left innovated at higher rates, while speakers on the right acted to preserve prior patterns. Key players such as Robespierre (on the left) and Abbé Maury (on the right) played information-processing roles emblematic of their politics. Newly created organizational functions—such as the Assembly president and committee chairs—had significant effects on debate outcomes, and a distinct transition appears midway through the parliament when committees, external to the debate process, gained new powers to “propose and dispose.” Taken together, these quantitative results align with existing qualitative interpretations, but also reveal crucial information-processing dynamics that have hitherto been overlooked. Great orators had the public’s attention, but deputies (mostly on the political left) who mastered the committee system gained new powers to shape revolutionary legislation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Barron","given":"Alexander T.

  {"id":"bastinGlobalTreeRestoration2019","abstract":"The potential for global forest cover\nThe restoration of forested land at a global scale could help capture atmospheric carbon and mitigate climate change. Bastin et al. used direct measurements of forest cover to generate a model of forest restoration potential across the globe (see the Perspective by Chazdon and Brancalion). Their spatially explicit maps show how much additional tree cover could exist outside of existing forests and agricultural and urban land. Ecosystems could support an additional 0.9 billion hectares of continuous forest. This would represent a greater than 25% increase in forested area, including more than 500 billion trees and more than 200 gigatonnes of additional carbon at maturity. Such a change has the potential to cut the atmospheric carbon pool by about 25%.\nScience, this issue p. 76; see also p. 24\nThe restoration of trees remains among the most effective strategies for climate change mitigation. We mapped the global potential tree coverage to show that 4.4 billion hectares of canopy cover could exist under the current climate. Excluding existing trees and agricultural and urban areas, we found that there is room for an extra 0.9 billion hectares of canopy cover, which could store 205 gigatonnes of carbon in areas that would naturally support woodlands and forests. This highlights global tree restoration as our most effective climate change solution to date. However, climate change will alter this potential tree coverage. We estimate that if we cannot deviate from the current trajectory, the global potential canopy cover may shrink by ~223 million hectares by 2050, with the vast majority of losses occurring in the tropics. Our results highlight the opportunity of climate change mitigation through global tree restoration but also the urgent need for action.\nThere is room on the planet for an extra 0.9 billion hectares of tree cover, supporting 517 billion trees and storing 205 Gt of carbon.\nThere is room on the planet for an extra 0.9 billion hectares of tree cover, supporting 517 billion trees and storing 205 Gt of carbon.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Bastin","given":"Jean-Francois"},{"family":"Finegold","given":"Yelena"},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Claude"},{"family":"Mollicone","given":"Danilo"},{"family":"Rezende","given":"Marcelo"},{"family":"Routh","given":"Devin"},{"family":"Zohner","given":"Constantin M."},{"family":"Crowther","given":"Thomas W."}],"citation-key":"bastinGlobalTreeRestoration2019","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aax0848","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6448","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,5]]},"language":"en","page":"76-79","PMID":"31273120","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"The global tree restoration potential","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76","volume":"365"},

However, the experiment also shows that social networks provide incentives to refer less qualified workers, and firms must counterbalance these incentives in order to effectively use existing employees to help overcome their screening problem.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Beaman","given":"Lori"},{"family":"Magruder","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"beamanWhoGetsJob2012","container-title":"American Economic Review","DOI":"10.1257/aer.102.7.3574","ISSN":"0002-8282","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,12]]},"language":"en","page":"3574-3593","source":"www.aeaweb.org","title":"Who Gets the Job Referral?

  {"id":"beckerMultiplexNetworkTies2020","abstract":"This article analyzes Martin Luther’s role in spreading the early Reformation, one of the most important episodes of radical institutional change in the last millennium. We argue that social relations played a key role in its diffusion because the spread of heterodox ideologies and their eventual institutionalization relied not only on private “infection” through exposure to innovation but also on active conversion and promotion of that new faith through personal ties. We conceive of that process as leader-to-follower directional influence originating with Luther and flowing to local elites through personal ties. Based on novel data on Luther’s correspondence, Luther’s visits, and student enrollments in Luther’s city of Wittenberg, we reconstruct Luther’s influence network to examine whether local connections to him increased the odds of adopting Protestantism. Using regression analyses and simulations based on empirical network data, we find that the combination of personal/relational diffusion via Luther’s multiplex ties and spatial/structural diffusion via trade routes fostered cities’ adoption of the Reformation, making possible Protestantism’s early breakthrough from a regional movement to a general rebellion against the Roman Catholic Church.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Becker","given":"Sascha O."},{"family":"Hsiao","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Pfaff","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Rubin","given":"Jared"}],"citation-key":"beckerMultiplexNetworkTies2020","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/0003122420948059","ISSN":"0003-1224","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"0003122420948059","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Multiplex Network Ties and the Spatial Diffusion of Radical Innovations: Martin Luther’s Leadership in the Early Reformation","title-short":"Multiplex Network Ties and the Spatial Diffusion of Radical Innovations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122420948059"},

  {"id":"beckertWhyPoorPlay2013","abstract":"Why do the poor spend more on lottery tickets than their wealthier and better educated peers? While social scientists generally agree that there is an inverse relationship between socio-economic position and patterns of lottery play, there is debate on what factors cause lottery gambling. Using survey data from a nationwide probability sample, we test three sociological approaches – socio-structural, cultural and social network accounts – to explain why the poor play the lottery. While controlling for cognitive bias theory, we find that peer play, educational attainment and self-perceived social deprivation have strong effects on lottery play. Culture, the study finds, plays a much lesser role. Although lottery players demonstrate fatalistic value orientations, it is not a lack of a ‘Protestant’ work ethic that makes the poor spend proportionally more on lottery tickets. The findings of this study generally point to the importance of social structures in explaining lottery gambling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,11,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Beckert","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Lutter","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"beckertWhyPoorPlay2013","container-title":"Sociology","container-title-short":"Sociology","DOI":"10.1177/0038038512457854","ISSN":"0038-0385, 1469-8684","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"1152-1170","source":"soc.sagepub.com","title":"Why the Poor Play the Lottery: Sociological Approaches to Explaining Class-based Lottery Play","title-short":"Why the Poor Play the Lottery","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://soc.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/12/16/0038038512457854","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"beckertWorthGoodsValuation2011","abstract":"How do we place value on goods - and, importantly, why? Valuation and pricing are core issues in the market economy, but understanding of these concepts and their interrelation is weak. In response, The Worth of Goods takes a sociological approach to the perennial but timely question of what makes a product valuable. Structured in three parts, it first examines value in the broader sense - moral values and how they are formed, and the relations between economic and non-economic values - discussing such matters as the value of an oil spill, the price of a scientific paper, value in ethical consumption, and imaginative value. The second part discusses the issues surrounding valuation in aesthetic markets, specifically wine, fashion models, art, and the creative industries. The third part analyzes valuation in financial markets - credit rating agencies, stock exchange markets, and industrial production.This pioneering volume brings together leading social scientists to provide a range of theoretical tools and case studies for understanding price and the creation of value in markets within social and cultural contexts and preconditions. It is an important source for scholars in economics, sociology, anthropology, and political science interested in how markets work, and how value is established.","author":[{"family":"Beckert","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Aspers","given":"Patrik"}],"citation-key":"beckertWorthGoodsValuation2011","ISBN":"978-0-19-959464-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,6,23]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"362","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Worth of Goods: Valuation and Pricing in the Economy","title-short":"The Worth of Goods","type":"book"},

  {"id":"belcherHowResearchSpace2009","abstract":"About a decade ago it was suggested (Belcher, 1997) that increasing diversity among professional academics writing in English, i.e., the growing presence of women and those (both men and women) from outside the Anglophone “inner circle” (Kachru, 1992), was exerting mounting pressure on established academia for greater tolerance of non-traditional, non-adversarial approaches to academic discourse. To what extent an increase in rhetorical diversity, however, has actually occurred in high-stakes, published academic writing has remained an open question. In an effort to address this question, research articles from 1996 through 2007 in three Anglophone language/literacy education journals were analyzed with attention given to the gender and cultural representativeness of the authors, and article introductions in all issues of two decade-apart volumes, 1996 and 2006, of the same journals were examined for their preferred style of argumentation, or more specifically, how they create a research space (Swales, 1990). The findings suggest improved diversity among contributors but less rhetorical diversity in their contributions than expected.

The post-industrial society’s dimensions would include the spread of a knowledge class, the change from goods to services and the role of women. All of these would be dependent on the expansion of services in the economic sector and an increasing dependence on science as the means of innovating and organizing technological change.Bell prophetically stated in The Coming of the Post-Industrial Society that we should expect “… new premises and new powers, new constraints and new questions—with the difference that these are now on a scale that had never been previously imagined in world history.”","author":[{"family":"Bell","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"bellComingPostindustrialSociety1973","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"0-7867-2473-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[1973]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"618","publisher":"Basic Books","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Google Books","title":"The Coming Of Post-industrial Society: A Venture in Social Forecasting","type":"book"},

Given the confusion in the literature about the key properties of fixed and random effects (FE and RE) models, we present these models’ capabilities and limitations. We also discuss the within-between RE model, sometimes misleadingly labelled a ‘hybrid’ model, showing that it is the most general of the three, with all the strengths of the other two. As such, and because it allows for important extensions—notably random slopes—we argue it should be used (as a starting point at least) in all multilevel analyses. We develop the argument through simulations, evaluating how these models cope with some likely mis-specifications. These simulations reveal that (1) failing to include random slopes can generate anti-conservative standard errors, and (2) assuming random intercepts are Normally distributed, when they are not, introduces only modest biases. These results strengthen the case for the use of, and need for, these models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Bell","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Fairbrother","given":"Malcolm"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Kelvyn"}],"citation-key":"bellFixedRandomEffects2019","container-title":"Quality & Quantity","container-title-short":"Qual Quant","DOI":"10.1007/s11135-018-0802-x","ISSN":"1573-7845","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1051-1074","source":"Springer Link","title":"Fixed and random effects models: making an informed choice","title-short":"Fixed and random effects models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11135-018-0802-x","volume":"53"},

  {"id":"bergBalancingCreativeHighwire2016","abstract":"Betting on the most promising new ideas is key to creativity and innovation in organizations, but predicting the success of novel ideas can be difficult. To select the best ideas, creators and managers must excel at creative forecasting, the skill of predicting the outcomes of new ideas. Using both a field study of 339 professionals in the circus arts industry and a lab experiment, I examine the conditions for accurate creative forecasting, focusing on the effect of creators’ and managers’ roles. In the field study, creators and managers forecasted the success of new circus acts with audiences, and the accuracy of these forecasts was assessed using data from 13,248 audience members. Results suggest that creators were more accurate than managers when forecasting about others’ novel ideas, but not their own. This advantage over managers was undermined when creators previously had poor ideas that were successful in the marketplace anyway. Results from the lab experiment show that creators’ advantage over managers in predicting success may be tied to the emphasis on both divergent thinking (idea generation) and convergent thinking (idea evaluation) in the creator role, while the manager role emphasizes only convergent thinking. These studies highlight that creative forecasting is a critical bridge linking creativity and innovation, shed light on the importance of roles in creative forecasting, and advance theory on why creative success is difficult to sustain over time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Berg","given":"Justin M."}],"citation-key":"bergBalancingCreativeHighwire2016","container-title":"Administrative Science Quarterly","container-title-short":"Administrative Science Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/0001839216642211","ISSN":"0001-8392","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"433-468","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Balancing on the Creative Highwire: Forecasting the Success of Novel Ideas in Organizations","title-short":"Balancing on the Creative Highwire","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0001839216642211","volume":"61"},

  {"id":"berinskyPublicationBiasesReplicationundefined/ed","abstract":"One of the strongest findings across the sciences is that publication bias occurs. Of particular note is a “file drawer bias” where statistically significant results are privileged over nonsignificant results. Recognition of this bias, along with increased calls for “open science,” has led to an emphasis on replication studies. Yet, few have explored publication bias and its consequences in replication studies. We offer a model of the publication process involving an initial study and a replication. We use the model to describe three types of publication biases: (1) file drawer bias, (2) a “repeat study” bias against the publication of replication studies, and (3) a “gotcha bias” where replication results that run contrary to a prior study are more likely to be published. We estimate the model’s parameters with a vignette experiment conducted with political science professors teaching at Ph.D. granting institutions in the United States. We find evidence of all three types of bias, although those explicitly involving replication studies are notably smaller. This bodes well for the replication movement. That said, the aggregation of all of the biases increases the number of false positives in a literature. We conclude by discussing a path for future work on publication biases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Berinsky","given":"Adam J."},{"family":"Druckman","given":"James N."},{"family":"Yamamoto","given":"Teppei"}],"citation-key":"berinskyPublicationBiasesReplicationundefined/ed","container-title":"Political Analysis","DOI":"10.1017/pan.2020.34","ISSN":"1047-1987, 1476-4989","issued":{"literal":"undefined/ed"},"language":"en","page":"1-15","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Publication Biases in Replication Studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/publication-biases-in-replication-studies/EA053746A49877FA119856FD05BE58D7"},

The focus is on the distinction between statistical significance and substantive, sociological significance. We review all articles published in the European Sociological Review between 2000–2004 and 2010–2014 that use regression models (N = 356). Our main aim is to determine whether the authors discuss the effect size of their findings and distinguish substantive from statistical significance. We apply a five-item questionnaire to each article and find that about half of the articles erroneously interpret a statistically insignificant coefficient as a zero effect, while only one in three engage in a discussion of the substantive meaning of the effect sizes. Moreover, our findings show a negative trend in the practice of significance testing over the past 15 years. These results are similar to those of the comparable review in the field of economics. We conclude by providing a set of recommendations on how to reduce the misuse of significance testing in sociological research, through an informed benchmarking of the findings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Bernardi","given":"Fabrizio"},{"family":"Chakhaia","given":"Lela"},{"family":"Leopold","given":"Liliya"}],"citation-key":"bernardiSingMeSong2017","container-title":"European Sociological Review","container-title-short":"European Sociological Review","DOI":"10.1093/esr/jcw047","ISSN":"0266-7215","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,1]]},"page":"1-15","source":"Silverchair","title":"‘Sing Me a Song with Social Significance’: The (Mis)Use of Statistical Significance Testing in European Sociological Research","title-short":"‘Sing Me a Song with Social Significance’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcw047","volume":"33"},

Ausgangspunkt der Argumentation ist die Annahme, dass die Netzwerkanalyse – als Methode verstanden – in einen feldtheoretischen Rahmen eingebunden werden kann. Netzwerke lassen sich dann als Phänomene charakterisieren, die analytisch auf ihren sozialen, praktischen und strukturellen Sinn hin zu untersuchen sind. Aus dieser Perspektive entsteht ein besonderer Informationsbedarf, dem mit einer rein standardisierten Netzwerkanalyse nicht beizukommen ist. Daher wird hier vorgeschlagen, qualitative und quantitative Verfahren der Netzwerkanalyse in einem primär qualitativ orientierten Vorgehen zu integrieren. Über eine solche Triangulation kann Wissen zur Relevanzstruktur eines Akteurs, zum motivationalen Hintergrund des Netzwerkkontakts, zu dessen inhaltlicher Ausformung und zeitlichen Veränderung sowie zur situativen und kontextuellen Entfaltung von Beziehungen verarbeitet werden. Anhand eines Beispiels wird gezeigt, wie die feldtheoretische Einbettung der Netzwerkeinbettungen mit Hilfe von Textanalysen und standardisierten Netzwerkdaten untersucht werden kann. Es wird herausgearbeitet, wie ein Akteur am Rande eines politischen Feldes bestrebt ist, über die Veränderung seines Netzwerks seine Position in der Struktur des Feldes zu verbessern.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Bernhard","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"bernhardForschungspragmatischeUberlegungenFeldtheoretischen2012","container-title":"Die Integration von Theorie und Methode in der Netzwerkforschung","editor":[{"family":"Hennig","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Stegbauer","given":"Christian"}],"ISBN":"978-3-531-17865-3 978-3-531-93464-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,1]]},"page":"117-132","publisher":"VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Forschungspragmatische Überlegungen zu einer feldtheoretischen Netzwerkanalyse","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-531-93464-8_7"},

So entstehen komplementäre Kompetenzen in voneinander weitgehend unverbundenen Forschungsbereichen: Auf der einen Seite entwickelt Bourdieu seine Praxistheorie (1976) zu einer allgemeinen Gesellschaftstheorie weiter die später immer mehr die Form einer allgemeinen Theorie sozialer Felder annimmt (Bourdieu 1974, Bourdieu 2001, [1992]; Bourdieu/Wacquant 1996).

In this essay we examine a trading room that was damaged in the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center. What did the crisis reveal about the social practices and the technological tools of trading? Drawing on ethnographic field research prior to September 11th, we show how the heterarchical (as opposed to hierarchical) organization of the trading room contributed to innovation on an ongoing basis. Drawing on our subsequent observations in the relocated trading room and focus group discussions with executives in other World Trade Center financial firms, we show that similarly heterarchical features contributed to innovation in response to crisis. Under conditions of radical uncertainty, one cannot know in advance what resources one will need, or even know in advance what might be a resource. Laterally distributed intelligence and a tolerance of multiple registers of valuation and interaction provide generative structures of resourcefulness where the replicative redundancy of contingency planning confronts its limits.

  {"id":"bhowmikComprehensiveAnalysisCOVID192021","abstract":"Background Several research efforts have evaluated the impact of various factors including a) socio-demographics, (b) health indicators, (c) mobility trends, and (d) health care infrastructure attributes on COVID-19 transmission and mortality rate. However, earlier research focused only on a subset of variable groups (predominantly one or two) that can contribute to the COVID-19 transmission/mortality rate. The current study effort is designed to remedy this by analyzing COVID-19 transmission/mortality rates considering a comprehensive set of factors in a unified framework. Methods and findings We study two per capita dependent variables: (1) daily COVID-19 transmission rates and (2) total COVID-19 mortality rates. The first variable is modeled using a linear mixed model while the later dimension is analyzed using a linear regression approach. The model results are augmented with a sensitivity analysis to predict the impact of mobility restrictions at a county level. Several county level factors including proportion of African-Americans, income inequality, health indicators associated with Asthma, Cancer, HIV and heart disease, percentage of stay at home individuals, testing infrastructure and Intensive Care Unit capacity impact transmission and/or mortality rates. From the policy analysis, we find that enforcing a stay at home order that can ensure a 50% stay at home rate can result in a potential reduction of about 33% in daily cases. Conclusions The model framework developed can be employed by government agencies to evaluate the influence of reduced mobility on transmission rates at a county level while accommodating for various county specific factors. Based on our policy analysis, the study findings support a county level stay at home order for regions currently experiencing a surge in transmission. The model framework can also be employed to identify vulnerable counties that need to be prioritized based on health indicators for current support and/or preferential vaccination plans (when available).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bhowmik","given":"Tanmoy"},{"family":"Tirtha","given":"Sudipta Dey"},{"family":"Iraganaboina","given":"Naveen Chandra"},{"family":"Eluru","given":"Naveen"}],"citation-key":"bhowmikComprehensiveAnalysisCOVID192021","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0249133","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e0249133","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"A comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 transmission and mortality rates at the county level in the United States considering socio-demographics, health indicators, mobility trends and health care infrastructure attributes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0249133","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"bidwellPayingMoreGet2011","abstract":"Individuals often enter similar jobs via two different routes: internal mobility and external hiring. I examine how the differences between these routes affect subsequent outcomes in those jobs. Drawing on theories of specific skills and incomplete information, I propose that external hires will initially perform worse than workers entering the job from inside the firm and have higher exit rates, yet they will be paid more and have stronger observable indicators of ability as measured by experience and education. I use the same theories to argue that the exact nature of internal mobility (promotions, lateral transfers, or combined promotions and transfers) will also affect workers’ outcomes. Analyses of personnel data from the U.S. investment banking arm of a financial services company from 2003 to 2009 confirm strong effects on pay, performance, and mobility of how workers enter jobs. I find that workers promoted into jobs have significantly better performance for the first two years than workers hired into similar jobs and lower rates of voluntary and involuntary exit. Nonetheless, the external hires are initially paid around 18 percent more than the promoted workers and have higher levels of experience and education. The hires are also promoted faster. I further find that workers who are promoted and transferred at the same time have worse performance than other internal movers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Bidwell","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"bidwellPayingMoreGet2011","container-title":"Administrative Science Quarterly","container-title-short":"Administrative Science Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/0001839211433562","ISSN":"0001-8392","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"369-407","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Paying More to Get Less: The Effects of External Hiring versus Internal Mobility","title-short":"Paying More to Get Less","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0001839211433562","volume":"56"},

  {"id":"blackVentureCapitalStructure1998","abstract":"The United States has many banks that are small relative to large corporations and play a limited role in corporate governance, and a well developed stock market with an associated market for corporate control. In contrast, Japanese and German banks are fewer in number but larger in relative size and are said to play a central governance role. Neither country has an active market for corporate control. We extend the debate on the relative efficiency of bank- and stock market-centered capital markets by developing a further systematic difference between the two systems: the greater vitality of venture capital in stock market-centered systems. Understanding the link between the stock market and the venture capital market requires understanding the contractual arrangements between entrepreneurs and venture capital providers; especially, the importance of the opportunity to enter into an implicit contract over control, which gives a successful entrepreneur the option to reacquire control from the venture capitalist by using an initial public offering as the means by which the venture capitalist exits from a portfolio investment. We also extend the literature on venture capital contracting by offering an explanation for two central characteristics of the U.S. venture capital market: relatively rapid exit by venture capital providers from investments in portfolio companies; and the common practice of exit through an initial public offering.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Black","given":"Bernard S"},{"family":"Gilson","given":"Ronald J"}],"citation-key":"blackVentureCapitalStructure1998","container-title":"Journal of Financial Economics","container-title-short":"Journal of Financial Economics","DOI":"10.1016/S0304-405X(97)00045-7","ISSN":"0304-405X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998,3,15]]},"page":"243-277","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Venture capital and the structure of capital markets: banks versus stock markets","title-short":"Venture capital and the structure of capital markets","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X97000457","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"blankChangingInequality2011","abstract":"Rebecca M. Blank offers the first comprehensive analysis of an economic trend that has been reshaping the United States over the past three decades: rapidly rising income inequality. In clear language, she provides an overview of how and why the level and distribution of income and wealth has changed since 1979, sets this situation within its historical context, and investigates the forces that are driving it. Among other factors, Blank looks closely at changes within families, including women’s increasing participation in the work force. The book includes some surprising findings—for example, that per-person income has risen sharply among almost all social groups, even as income has become more unequally distributed. Looking toward the future, Blank suggests that while rising inequality will likely be with us for many decades to come, it is not an inevitable outcome. Her book considers what can be done to address this trend, and also explores the question: why should we be concerned about this phenomenon?","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Blank","given":"Rebecca M."}],"citation-key":"blankChangingInequality2011","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-520-26692-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"publisher":"University of California Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"Changing Inequality","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnkww"},

  {"id":"bleiCorrelatedTopicModel2007","abstract":"Topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), can be useful tools for the statistical analysis of document collections and other discrete data. The LDA model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a distribution over the vocabulary. A limitation of LDA is the inability to model topic correlation even though, for example, a document about genetics is more likely to also be about disease than X-ray astronomy. This limitation stems from the use of the Dirichlet distribution to model the variability among the topic proportions. In this paper we develop the correlated topic model (CTM), where the topic proportions exhibit correlation via the logistic normal distribution [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 44 (1982) 139–177]. We derive a fast variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference in this model, which is complicated by the fact that the logistic normal is not conjugate to the multinomial. We apply the CTM to the articles from Science published from 1990–1999, a data set that comprises 57M words. The CTM gives a better fit of the data than LDA, and we demonstrate its use as an exploratory tool of large document collections.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Blei","given":"David M."},{"family":"Lafferty","given":"John D."}],"citation-key":"bleiCorrelatedTopicModel2007","container-title":"The Annals of Applied Statistics","container-title-short":"Ann.

  {"id":"bollenHistoricalLanguageRecords2021","abstract":"Individuals with depression are prone to maladaptive patterns of thinking, known as cognitive distortions, whereby they think about themselves, the world, and the future in overly negative and inaccurate ways. These distortions are associated with marked changes in an individual’s mood, behavior, and language. We hypothesize that societies can undergo similar changes in their collective psychology that are reflected in historical records of language use. Here, we investigate the prevalence of textual markers of cognitive distortions in over 14 million books for the past 125 y and observe a surge of their prevalence since the 1980s, to levels exceeding those of the Great Depression and both World Wars. This pattern does not seem to be driven by changes in word meaning, publishing and writing standards, or the Google Books sample. Our results suggest a recent societal shift toward language associated with cognitive distortions and internalizing disorders.\nAuthor Information\nJohan Bollena,1, Marijn ten Thija,b, Fritz Breithauptc, Alexander T.

  {"id":"bollenTwitterMoodPredicts2011","abstract":"Behavioral economics tells us that emotions can profoundly affect individual behavior and decision-making. Does this also apply to societies at large, i.e. can societies experience mood states that affect their collective decision making? By extension is the public mood correlated or even predictive of economic indicators? Here we investigate whether measurements of collective mood states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time. We analyze the text content of daily Twitter feeds by two mood tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder that measures positive vs. negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) that measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, and Happy). We cross-validate the resulting mood time series by comparing their ability to detect the public's response to the presidential election and Thanksgiving day in 2008. A Granger causality analysis and a Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network are then used to investigate the hypothesis that public mood states, as measured by the OpinionFinder and GPOMS mood time series, are predictive of changes in DJIA closing values. Our results indicate that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly improved by the inclusion of specific public mood dimensions but not others. We find an accuracy of 86.7% in predicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of the DJIA and a reduction of the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) by more than 6%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Bollen","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Mao","given":"Huina"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Xiaojun"}],"citation-key":"bollenTwitterMoodPredicts2011","container-title":"Journal of Computational Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Computational Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jocs.2010.12.007","ISSN":"1877-7503","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,3]]},"page":"1-8","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Twitter mood predicts the stock market","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187775031100007X","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"bonillaElevatedThreatLevels2013","abstract":"A persistent concern in democracies is that terror threats make the public willing to restrict freedoms for increased safety. But a large literature has struggled to determine how terrorist threats affect the public's policy preferences. To more credibly estimate the effects of terror threats, we exploit elevations of the U.S. government's color coded alert system. Using this design, a statistical model for texts and a new collection of news stories, we show that media outlets allocate substantially more attention to terrorism after an alert. The alerts have, however, only a limited effect on the public. The terror alerts raise the public's perceived likelihood of a terror attack, but opinion about President Bush's job performance, preferences for foreign intervention, or willingness to restrict civil liberties changes little in response to the alerts. Rather, the only consistent result is decreased economic expectations—consistent with the strong economic downturn after the 9/11 attacks and the types of stories published after the terror alerts are elevated. Terror alerts, then, did not exercise direct influence on the public's policy preferences. Instead the alerts changed the topic of conversation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Bonilla","given":"Tabitha"},{"family":"Grimmer","given":"Justin"}],"citation-key":"bonillaElevatedThreatLevels2013","collection-title":"Topic Models and the Cultural Sciences","container-title":"Poetics","container-title-short":"Poetics","DOI":"10.1016/j.poetic.2013.06.003","ISSN":"0304-422X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"650-669","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Elevated threat levels and decreased expectations: How democracy handles terrorist threats","title-short":"Elevated threat levels and decreased expectations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X13000430","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"bordinoWebSearchQueries2012","abstract":"We live in a computerized and networked society where many of our actions leave a digital trace and affect other people’s actions. This has lead to the emergence of a new data-driven research field: mathematical methods of computer science, statistical physics and sociometry provide insights on a wide range of disciplines ranging from social science to human mobility. A recent important discovery is that search engine traffic (i.e., the number of requests submitted by users to search engines on the www) can be used to track and, in some cases, to anticipate the dynamics of social phenomena. Successful examples include unemployment levels, car and home sales, and epidemics spreading. Few recent works applied this approach to stock prices and market sentiment. However, it remains unclear if trends in financial markets can be anticipated by the collective wisdom of on-line users on the web. Here we show that daily trading volumes of stocks traded in NASDAQ-100 are correlated with daily volumes of queries related to the same stocks. In particular, query volumes anticipate in many cases peaks of trading by one day or more. Our analysis is carried out on a unique dataset of queries, submitted to an important web search engine, which enable us to investigate also the user behavior. We show that the query volume dynamics emerges from the collective but seemingly uncoordinated activity of many users. These findings contribute to the debate on the identification of early warnings of financial systemic risk, based on the activity of users of the www.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bordino","given":"Ilaria"},{"family":"Battiston","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Caldarelli","given":"Guido"},{"family":"Cristelli","given":"Matthieu"},{"family":"Ukkonen","given":"Antti"},{"family":"Weber","given":"Ingmar"}],"citation-key":"bordinoWebSearchQueries2012","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040014","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,7,19]]},"page":"e40014","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Web Search Queries Can Predict Stock Market Volumes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0040014","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"bordonsRelationshipResearchPerformance2015","abstract":"Research networks play a crucial role in the production of new knowledge since collaboration contributes to determine the cognitive and social structure of scientific fields and has a positive influence on research. This paper analyses the structure of co-authorship networks in three different fields (Nanoscience, Pharmacology and Statistics) in Spain over a three-year period (2006–2008) and explores the relationship between the research performance of scientists and their position in co-authorship networks. A denser co-authorship network is found in the two experimental fields than in Statistics, where the network is of a less connected and more fragmented nature. Using the g-index as a proxy for individual research performance, a Poisson regression model is used to explore how performance is related to different co-authorship network measures and to disclose interfield differences. The number of co-authors (degree centrality) and the strength of links show a positive relationship with the g-index in the three fields. Local cohesion presents a negative relationship with the g-index in the two experimental fields, where open networks and the diversity of co-authors seem to be beneficial. No clear advantages from intermediary positions (high betweenness) or from being linked to well-connected authors (high eigenvector) can be inferred from this analysis. In terms of g-index, the benefits derived by authors from their position in co-authorship networks are larger in the two experimental fields than in the theoretical one.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Bordons","given":"María"},{"family":"Aparicio","given":"Javier"},{"family":"González-Albo","given":"Borja"},{"family":"Díaz-Faes","given":"Adrián A."}],"citation-key":"bordonsRelationshipResearchPerformance2015","container-title":"Journal of Informetrics","container-title-short":"Journal of Informetrics","DOI":"10.1016/j.joi.2014.12.001","ISSN":"1751-1577","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1]]},"page":"135-144","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The relationship between the research performance of scientists and their position in co-authorship networks in three fields","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157714001138","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"borkenhagenStatusCareerMobility2018","abstract":"Using a set of user-generated data, we examine patterns in the careers of professional chefs. We argue that this is one of many cases in which careers must be understood as shaped by dual structures—the typical occupational structure within a firm, and the organization of firms in a larger field. We then demonstrate how career trajectories may be formalized as movement through a two-dimensional space defined by status in these structures. Building on previous ethnographic work finding that chefs understand the logic of their careers as involving repeated trade-offs between their occupational status (their rank within the kitchen) and organizational status (the status of the restaurant at which they work), we attempt to determine how different trajectories are associated with different outcomes. We find that, despite the somewhat random nature of entrance into the culinary profession, future top-tier chefs disproportionately begin their careers at high-status restaurants. Beyond their auspicious beginnings, these top-chefs-to-be also commonly devote their early careers to maximizing organizational status, forgoing promotions to higher kitchen ranks in favor of low-level jobs at more prestigious restaurants. By comparison, chefs destined to run lower-status restaurants tend to spend their early careers prioritizing rapid advancement within the kitchen, only pursuing jobs at more prestigious restaurants much later in their careers, with limited success.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Borkenhagen","given":"Chad"},{"family":"Martin","given":"John Levi"}],"citation-key":"borkenhagenStatusCareerMobility2018","container-title":"Social Forces","container-title-short":"Social Forces","DOI":"10.1093/sf/soy024","ISSN":"0037-7732","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,1]]},"page":"1-26","source":"Silverchair","title":"Status and Career Mobility in Organizational Fields: Chefs and Restaurants in the United States, 1990–2013","title-short":"Status and Career Mobility in Organizational Fields","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soy024","volume":"97"},

Academic literature from the past 10 years has been systematically reviewed and contextualized through a series of expert interviews. Design/methodology/approach The authors present a systematic review of the literature to identify KPIs and methods of workplace productivity measurement, complemented by insights semi-structured interviews to inform a framework for a benchmarking tool. In total, 513 papers published since 2007 were considered, of which 98 full-length papers were reviewed, and 20 were found to provide significant insight and are summarized herein. Findings Currently, no consensus exists on a single KPI suitable for measuring workplace productivity in an office environment, although qualitative questionnaires are more widely adopted than quantitative tools. The diversity of KPIs used in published studies indicates that a multidimensional approach would be the most appropriate for knowledge-worker productivity measurement. Expert interviews further highlighted a shift from infrequent, detailed evaluation to frequent, simplified reporting across human resource functions and this context is important for future tool development. Originality/value This paper provides a summary of significant work on workplace productivity measurement and KPI development over the past 10 years. This follows up on the comprehensive review by B.

The interbank market is interpreted as a network where banks are nodes and the claims and liabilities between banks define the links. This allows us to apply methods from general network theory. We find that the degree distributions of the interbank network follow power laws. Given this result we discuss how the network structure affects the stability of the banking system with respect to the elimination of a node in the network, i.e. the default of a single bank. Further, the interbank liability network shows a community structure that exactly mirrors the regional and sectoral organization of the current Austrian banking system. The banking network has the typical structural features found in numerous other complex real-world networks: a low clustering coefficient and a short average path length. These empirical findings are in marked contrast to the network structures that have been assumed thus far in the theoretical economic and econo-physics literature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Boss","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Elsinger","given":"Helmut"},{"family":"Summer","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Thurner 4","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"bossNetworkTopologyInterbank2004","container-title":"Quantitative Finance","DOI":"10.1080/14697680400020325","ISSN":"1469-7688","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"page":"677-684","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Network topology of the interbank market","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14697680400020325","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"bourdieuDistinction1984","abstract":"No judgement of taste is innocent - we are all snobs. Pierre Bourdieu's Distinction brilliantly illuminates the social pretentions of the middle classes in the modern world, focusing on the tastes and preferences of the French bourgeoisie. First published in 1979, the book is at once a vast ethnography of contemporary France and a dissection of the bourgeois mind. In the course of everyday life we constantly choose between what we find aesthetically pleasing, and what we consider tacky, merely trendy, or ugly. Taste is not pure. Bourdieu demonstrates that our different aesthetic choices are all distinctions - that is, choices made in opposition to those made by other classes. This fascinating work argues that the social world functions simultaneously as a system of power relations and as a symbolic system in which minute distinctions of taste become the basis for social judgement.","author":[{"family":"Bourdieu","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"bourdieuDistinction1984","event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-0-415-56788-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[1984]]},"language":"Englisch","number-of-pages":"640","publisher":"Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"Amazon","title":"Distinction","type":"book"},

  {"id":"bourdieuFieldCulturalProduction1983","abstract":"To be fully understood, literary production has to be approached in relational terms, by constructing the literary field, i.e. the space of literary prises de position that are possible in a given period in a given society. Prises de position arise from the encounter between particular agents' dispositions (their habitus, shaped by their social trajectory) and their position in a field of positions which is defined by the distribution of a specific form of capital. This specific literary (or artistic, or philosophical, etc.) capital functions within an ‘economy’ whose logic is an inversion of the logic of the larger economy of the society. The ‘interest in distinterestedness’ can be understood by examining the structural relations between the field of literary production and the field of class relations. A number of effects within the literary field arise from the homologies between positions within the two fields. This model is then used to analyze the particular case of the literary field in late 19th century France.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bourdieu","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"bourdieuFieldCulturalProduction1983","container-title":"Poetics","container-title-short":"Poetics","DOI":"10.1016/0304-422X(83)90012-8","ISSN":"0304-422X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1983,11,1]]},"page":"311-356","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The field of cultural production, or: The economic world reversed","title-short":"The field of cultural production, or","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304422X83900128","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"bourdieuInvitationReflexiveSociology1992","abstract":"Over the last three decades, the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu has produced one of the most imaginative and subtle bodies of social theory and research of the post war era. Yet, despite the influence of his work, no single introduction to his wide-ranging oeuvre is available. This book, intended for an English-speaking audience, offers a systematic and accessible overview, providing interpretive keys to the internal logic of Bourdieu's work by explicating thematic and methodological principles underlying his work.  The structure of Bourdieu's theory of knowledge, practice, and society is first dissected by Loic Wacquant he then collaborates with Bourdieu in a dialogue in which they discuss central concepts of Bourdieu's work, confront the main objections and criticisms his work has met, and outline Bourdieu's views of the relation of sociology to philosophy, economics, history, and politics. The final section captures Bourdieu in action in the seminar room as he addresses the topic of how to practice the craft of reflexive sociology. Throughout, they stress Bourdieu's emphasis on reflexivity -- his inclusion of a theory of intellectual practice as an integral component of a theory of society -- and on method -- particularly his manner of posing problems that permits a transfer of knowledge from one area of inquiry into another. -- Publisher description.","author":[{"family":"Bourdieu","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Wacquant","given":"Loïc J.

  {"id":"bourdieuLanguageSymbolicPower1991","abstract":"This volume brings together Pierre Bourdieu's highly original writings on language and on the relations among language, power, and politics. Bourdieu develops a forceful critique of traditional approaches to language, including the linguistic theories of Saussure and Chomsky and the theory of speech-acts elaborated by Austin and others. He argues that language should be viewed not only as a means of communication but also as a medium of power through which individuals pursue their own interests and display their practical competence. Drawing on the concepts that are part of his distinctive theoretical approach, Bourdieu maintains that linguistic utterances or expressions can be understood as the product of the relation between a \"linguistic market\" and a \"linguistic habitus.\" When individuals use language in particular ways, they deploy their accumulated linguistic resources and implicitly adapt their words to the demands of the social field or market that is their audience. Hence every linguistic interaction, however personal or insignificant it may seem, bears the traces of the social structure that it both expresses and helps to reproduce. Bourdieu's account sheds fresh light on the ways in which linguistic usage varies according to considerations such as class and gender. It also opens up a new approach to the ways in which language is used in the domain of politics. For politics is, among other things, the arena in which words are deeds and the symbolic character of power is at stake. This volume, by one of the leading social thinkers in the world today, represents a major contribution to the study of language and power. It will be of interest to students throughout the social sciences and humanities, especially in sociology, politics, anthropology, linguistics, and literature.","author":[{"family":"Bourdieu","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"bourdieuLanguageSymbolicPower1991","ISBN":"978-0-674-51041-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[1991]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"324","publisher":"Harvard University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Language and Symbolic Power","type":"book"},

  {"id":"bourdieuOutlineTheoryPractice1977","abstract":"Outline of a Theory of Practice is recognized as a major theoretical text on the foundations of anthropology and sociology. Pierre Bourdieu, a distinguished French anthropologist, develops a theory of practice which is simultaneously a critique of the methods and postures of social science and a general account of how human action should be understood. With his central concept of the habitus, the principle which negotiates between objective structures and practices, Bourdieu is able to transcend the dichotomies which have shaped theoretical thinking about the social world. The author draws on his fieldwork in Kabylia (Algeria) to illustrate his theoretical propositions. With detailed study of matrimonial strategies and the role of rite and myth, he analyses the dialectical process of the 'incorporation of structures' and the objectification of habitus, whereby social formations tend to reproduce themselves. A rigorous consistent materialist approach lays the foundations for a theory of symbolic capital and, through analysis of the different modes of domination, a theory of symbolic power.","author":[{"family":"Bourdieu","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"bourdieuOutlineTheoryPractice1977","event-place":"Cambridge, UK","ISBN":"978-0-521-29164-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1977]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"260","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, UK","source":"Google Books","title":"Outline of a Theory of Practice","type":"book"},

Existing research shows that, while men are more likely than women to be promoted at the different stages of the academic career, no such difference is found when it comes to faculty retention rates. Current research on faculty retention, however, focuses on careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). We extend this line of inquiry to the social sciences. Methods We follow 2,218 tenure-track assistant professors hired since 1990 in seven social science disciplines at nineteen U.S. universities from time of hire to time of departure. We also track their time to promotion to associate and full professor. Using survival analysis, we examine gender differences in time to departure and time to promotion. Our methods account for censoring and unobserved heterogeneity, as well as effect heterogeneity across disciplines and cohorts. Results We find no statistically significant differences between genders in faculty retention. However, we do find that men are more likely to be granted tenure than women. When it comes to promotion to full professor, the results are less conclusive, as the effect of gender is sensitive to model specification. Conclusions The results corroborate previous findings about gender patterns in faculty retention and promotion. They suggest that advances have been made when it comes to gender equality in retention and promotion, but important differences still persist.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Box-Steffensmeier","given":"Janet M."},{"family":"Cunha","given":"Raphael C."},{"family":"Varbanov","given":"Roumen A."},{"family":"Hoh","given":"Yee Shwen"},{"family":"Knisley","given":"Margaret L."},{"family":"Holmes","given":"Mary Alice"}],"citation-key":"box-steffensmeierSurvivalAnalysisFaculty2015","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0143093","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,11,18]]},"language":"en","page":"e0143093","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Survival Analysis of Faculty Retention and Promotion in the Social Sciences by Gender","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0143093","volume":"10"},

Several mapping techniques are demonstrated on a data set comprising 20 years of papers published in PNAS. Data from a variety of sources are merged to provide unique indicators of the domain bounded by PNAS. By using funding source information and citation counts, it is shown that, on an aggregate basis, papers funded jointly by the U.S. Public Health Service (which includes the National Institutes of Health) and non-U.S. government sources outperform papers funded by other sources, including by the U.S. Public Health Service alone. Grant data from the National Institute on Aging show that, on average, papers from large grants are cited more than those from small grants, with performance increasing with grant amount.

  {"id":"boyackMappingStructureEvolution2009","abstract":"How does our collective scholarly knowledge grow over time? What major areas of science exist and how are they interlinked? Which areas are major knowledge producers; which ones are consumers? Computational scientometrics — the application of bibliometric/scientometric methods to large-scale scholarly datasets — and the communication of results via maps of science might help us answer these questions. This paper represents the results of a prototype study that aims to map the structure and evolution of chemistry research over a 30 year time frame. Information from the combined Science (SCIE) and Social Science (SSCI) Citations Indexes from 2002 was used to generate a disciplinary map of 7,227 journals and 671 journal clusters. Clusters relevant to study the structure and evolution of chemistry were identified using JCR categories and were further clustered into 14 disciplines.

  {"id":"bozemanScientistsCollaborationStrategies2004","abstract":"“Scientific and technical human capital” (S&amp;T human capital) has been defined as the sum of researchers’ professional network ties and their technical skills and resources [Int. J. Technol. Manage. 22 (7–8) (2001) 636]. Our study focuses on one particular means by which scientists acquire and deploy S&amp;T human capital, research collaboration. We examine data from 451 scientists and engineers at academic research centers in the United States. The chief focus is on scientists’ collaboration choices and strategies. Since we are particularly interested in S&amp;T human capital, we pay special attention to strategies that involve mentoring graduate students and junior faculty and to collaborating with women. We also examine collaboration “cosmopolitanism,” the extent to which scientists collaborate with those around them (one’s research group, one’s university) as opposed to those more distant in geography or institutional setting (other universities, researchers in industry, researchers in other nations). Our findings indicate that those who pursue a “mentor” collaboration strategy are likely to be tenured; to collaborate with women; and to have a favorable view about industry and research on industrial applications. Regarding the number of reported collaborators, those who have larger grants have more collaborators. With respect to the percentage of female collaborators, we found, not surprisingly, that female scientists have a somewhat higher percentage (36%) of female collaborators, than males have (24%). There are great differences, however, according to rank, with non-tenure track females having 84% of their collaborations with females. Regarding collaboration cosmopolitanism, we find that most researchers are not particularly cosmopolitan in their selection of collaborators—they tend to work with the people in their own work group. More cosmopolitan collaborators tend have large grants. A major policy implication is that there is great variance in the extent to which collaborations seem to enhance or generate S&amp;T human capital. Not all collaborations are equal with respect to their “public goods” implications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Bozeman","given":"Barry"},{"family":"Corley","given":"Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"bozemanScientistsCollaborationStrategies2004","collection-title":"Scientific and Technical Human Capital: Science Careers and Networks as Knowledge Assets","container-title":"Research Policy","container-title-short":"Research Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.respol.2004.01.008","ISSN":"0048-7333","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,5]]},"page":"599-616","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Scientists’ collaboration strategies: implications for scientific and technical human capital","title-short":"Scientists’ collaboration strategies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733304000162","volume":"33"},

We develop a simple model where researchers allocate their effort between improving existing fields and inventing new ones. A key assumption is that scientists derive utility from recognition from other scientists. We show that the economy can be either in a regime where new fields are constantly invented, and then converges to a steady state, or in a cyclical regime where periods of innovation alternate with periods of exploitation. Our analysis provides a rigorous foundation to the Kuhnian theory of scientific evolution. We show that scientists' care for reputation has a strong impact on research dynamics and tends to favor innovation. Especially, innovation fads may emerge.

In this paper, we argue that eponyms are a promising way to explore historic relationships between natural scientists using taxonomy. Our empirical case is the emerging community of malacologists in the 19th century. Along the lines of pivotal concepts of social network analysis we interpret eponyms as immaterial goods that resemble the proporties of regular social contacts. Utilising Exponential Random Graph Models reveals that the social exchange underlying eponyms follows similar rules as other social relationships such as friendships or collaborations. It is generally characterized by network endogenous structures and homophily. Interestingly, the productivity of authors seems to be well recognised among contemporary researchers and increases the probability of a tie within the network significantly. In addition, we observe an epistemological divide in the malacological research community. Thus even in the 19th century, at a time when science was just emerging as a differentiated social system, epistemological distinctions have been a defining concept for scientific contacts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Breure","given":"Abraham S.

We argue that stock market liquidity influences payout policy through a first-order effect on the share repurchase decision, and a second-order or residual effect on the dividend decision. Managers compare the tax and flexibility advantages of a repurchase against its liquidity cost disadvantage. All else equal, higher market liquidity encourages the use of repurchases over dividends. Our empirical results confirm that stock market liquidity plays a significant role in repurchase and dividend initiations, as well as in recurring payout decisions. Unlike previous studies that measure liquidity changes following the repurchase decision, we examine liquidity levels prior to the payout decision. We show that managers condition their repurchase decision on a sufficient level of market liquidity, consistent with Barclay and Smith's [Barclay, M.J., Smith, C.W. Jr., 1988.

  {"id":"bromhamInterdisciplinaryResearchHas2016","abstract":"Interdisciplinary research is widely considered a hothouse for innovation, and the only plausible approach to complex problems such as climate change1,2. One barrier to interdisciplinary research is the widespread perception that interdisciplinary projects are less likely to be funded than those with a narrower focus3,4. However, this commonly held belief has been difficult to evaluate objectively, partly because of lack of a comparable, quantitative measure of degree of interdisciplinarity that can be applied to funding application data1. Here we compare the degree to which research proposals span disparate fields by using a biodiversity metric that captures the relative representation of different fields (balance) and their degree of difference (disparity). The Australian Research Council’s Discovery Programme provides an ideal test case, because a single annual nationwide competitive grants scheme covers fundamental research in all disciplines, including arts, humanities and sciences. Using data on all 18,476 proposals submitted to the scheme over 5 consecutive years, including successful and unsuccessful applications, we show that the greater the degree of interdisciplinarity, the lower the probability of being funded. The negative impact of interdisciplinarity is significant even when number of collaborators, primary research field and type of institution are taken into account. This is the first broad-scale quantitative assessment of success rates of interdisciplinary research proposals. The interdisciplinary distance metric allows efficient evaluation of trends in research funding, and could be used to identify proposals that require assessment strategies appropriate to interdisciplinary research5.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bromham","given":"Lindell"},{"family":"Dinnage","given":"Russell"},{"family":"Hua","given":"Xia"}],"citation-key":"bromhamInterdisciplinaryResearchHas2016","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature18315","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7609","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6]]},"language":"en","page":"684-687","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Interdisciplinary research has consistently lower funding success","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18315","volume":"534"},

  {"id":"brothertonMeasuringBeliefConspiracy2013","abstract":"The psychology of conspiracy theory beliefs is not yet well understood, although research indicates that there are stable individual differences in conspiracist ideation – individuals’ general tendency to engage with conspiracy theories. Researchers have created several short self-report measures of conspiracist ideation. These measures largely consist of items referring to an assortment of prominent conspiracy theories regarding specific real-world events. However, these instruments have not been psychometrically validated, and this assessment approach suffers from practical and theoretical limitations. Therefore, we present the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs (GCB) scale: a novel measure of individual differences in generic conspiracist ideation. The scale was developed and validated across four studies. In Study 1, exploratory factor analysis of a novel 75-item measure of non-event-based conspiracist beliefs identified five conspiracist facets. The 15-item GCB scale was developed to sample from each of these themes. Studies 2, 3 and 4 examined the structure and validity of the GCB, demonstrating internal reliability, content, criterion-related, convergent and discriminant validity, and good test-retest reliability. In sum, this research indicates that the GCB is a psychometrically sound and practically useful measure of conspiracist ideation, and the findings add to our theoretical understanding of conspiracist ideation as a monological belief system unpinned by a relatively small number of generic assumptions about the typicality of conspiratorial activity in the world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Brotherton","given":"Robert"},{"family":"French","given":"Christopher C."},{"family":"Pickering","given":"Alan D."}],"citation-key":"brothertonMeasuringBeliefConspiracy2013","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

We observe that the expected pattern of growth of the complexity of the quantum system parallels the growth of entropy of the classical system.

The bursting of the housing bubble forced banks to write down several hundred billion dollars in bad loans caused by mortgage delinquencies. At the same time, the stock market capitalization of the major banks declined by more than twice as much. While the overall mortgage losses are large on an absolute scale, they are still relatively modest compared to the $8 trillion of U.S. stock market wealth lost between October 2007, when the stock market reached an all-time high, and October 2008. This paper attempts to explain the economic mechanisms that caused losses in the mortgage market to amplify into such large dislocations and turmoil in the financial markets, and describes common economic threads that explain the plethora of market declines, liquidity dry-ups, defaults, and bailouts that occurred after the crisis broke in summer 2007.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Brunnermeier","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"brunnermeierDecipheringLiquidityCredit2009","container-title":"Journal of Economic Perspectives","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"77-100","source":"RePEc - IDEAS","title":"Deciphering the Liquidity and Credit Crunch 2007-2008","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/jecper/v23y2009i1p77-100.html","volume":"23"},

The study is performed by using 49 industry index time series computed by K. French and E. Fama during the time period from July 1969 to December 2011, which spans more than 40 years. We show that the correlation between industry indices presents both a fast and a slow dynamics. The slow dynamics has a time scale longer than 5 years, showing that a different degree of diversification of the investment is possible in different periods of time. Moreover, we also detect a fast dynamics associated with exogenous or endogenous events. The fast time scale we use is a monthly time scale and the evaluation time period is a 3-month time period. By investigating the correlation dynamics monthly, we are able to detect two examples of fast variations in the first and second eigenvalue of the correlation matrix. The first occurs during the dot-com bubble (from March 1999 to April 2001) and the second occurs during the period of highest impact of the subprime crisis (from August 2008 to August 2009).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Buccheri","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Marmi","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Mantegna","given":"Rosario N."}],"citation-key":"buccheriEvolutionCorrelationStructure2013","container-title":"Physical Review E","container-title-short":"Phys.

  {"id":"buldyrevCatastrophicCascadeFailures2010","abstract":"Complex networks have been studied intensively for a decade, but research still focuses on the limited case of a single, non-interacting network. Modern systems are coupled together and therefore should be modelled as interdependent networks. A fundamental property of interdependent networks is that failure of nodes in one network may lead to failure of dependent nodes in other networks. This may happen recursively and can lead to a cascade of failures. In fact, a failure of a very small fraction of nodes in one network may lead to the complete fragmentation of a system of several interdependent networks. A dramatic real-world example of a cascade of failures (‘concurrent malfunction’) is the electrical blackout that affected much of Italy on 28 September 2003: the shutdown of power stations directly led to the failure of nodes in the Internet communication network, which in turn caused further breakdown of power stations. Here we develop a framework for understanding the robustness of interacting networks subject to such cascading failures. We present exact analytical solutions for the critical fraction of nodes that, on removal, will lead to a failure cascade and to a complete fragmentation of two interdependent networks. Surprisingly, a broader degree distribution increases the vulnerability of interdependent networks to random failure, which is opposite to how a single network behaves. Our findings highlight the need to consider interdependent network properties in designing robust networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Buldyrev","given":"Sergey V."},{"family":"Parshani","given":"Roni"},{"family":"Paul","given":"Gerald"},{"family":"Stanley","given":"H.

I use the theories of Weber and Bourdieu to advance an alternative view of departmental prestige, which I show is an effect a department's position within networks of association and social exchange—that is, it is a form of social capital. The social network created by the exchange of PhDs among departments is the most important network of this kind. Using data on the exchange of PhDs among sociology departments, I apply network analysis to investigate this alternative conception of departmental prestige and to demonstrate its superiority over the conventional view. Within sociology, centrality within interdepartmental hiring networks explains 84 percent of the variance in departmental prestige. Similar findings are reported for history and political science. This alternative understanding of academic prestige helps clarify anomalies—e.g., the variance in prestige unconnected to scholarly productivity, the strong association between department size and prestige, and the long-term stability of prestige rankings—encountered in research that is based on the more conventional view.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Burris","given":"Val"}],"citation-key":"burrisAcademicCasteSystem2004","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.1177/000312240406900205","ISSN":"0003-1224, 1939-8271","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"239-264","source":"asr.sagepub.com","title":"The Academic Caste System: Prestige Hierarchies in PhD Exchange Networks","title-short":"The Academic Caste System","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://asr.sagepub.com/content/69/2/239","volume":"69"},

Using two-wave panel data from over 20,000 students in 56 middle schools, we first examine the relationship between change in conflict with schoolmates and change in a network-derived metric of status, betweenness centrality, which is an indicator of being well known. More overall conflict with students is associated with increases in status up to a threshold. Additionally, students who perceive more conflict with others who do not perceive conflict in return also gain status. Finally, more conflict with friends does not increase status. Based on this evidence, we propose a mechanism by which conflict increases status through signaling integration in the school’s social scene rather than through establishing dominance over others, as previous literature suggests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Callejas","given":"Laura M."},{"family":"Shepherd","given":"Hana"}],"citation-key":"callejasConflictSocialStatus2020","container-title":"Social Psychology Quarterly","container-title-short":"Soc Psychol Q","DOI":"10.1177/0190272519876936","ISSN":"0190-2725","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,3]]},"language":"en","page":"0190272519876936","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Conflict as a Social Status Mobility Mechanism in Schools: A Network Approach","title-short":"Conflict as a Social Status Mobility Mechanism in Schools","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0190272519876936"},

For this purpose, empirical evidence from a multi-country survey is examined using social network analysis (SNA). The information is compared across building typologies, project types and countries (i.e., Italy, Spain, Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and the Netherlands). The results demonstrate that, in EU residential buildings, potential adopters of the technology are not the only stakeholders involved in the technology selection. They are in all instances in communication with multiple stakeholders, some of whom also hold a high level of power in the decision (i.e., key persuaders).

  {"id":"camererEvaluatingReplicabilitySocial2018","abstract":"Being able to replicate scientific findings is crucial for scientific progress1–15. We replicate 21 systematically selected experimental studies in the social sciences published in Nature and Science between 2010 and 201516–36. The replications follow analysis plans reviewed by the original authors and pre-registered prior to the replications. The replications are high powered, with sample sizes on average about five times higher than in the original studies. We find a significant effect in the same direction as the original study for 13 (62%) studies, and the effect size of the replications is on average about 50% of the original effect size. Replicability varies between 12 (57%) and 14 (67%) studies for complementary replicability indicators. Consistent with these results, the estimated true-positive rate is 67% in a Bayesian analysis. The relative effect size of true positives is estimated to be 71%, suggesting that both false positives and inflated effect sizes of true positives contribute to imperfect reproducibility. Furthermore, we find that peer beliefs of replicability are strongly related to replicability, suggesting that the research community could predict which results would replicate and that failures to replicate were not the result of chance alone.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Camerer","given":"Colin F."},{"family":"Dreber","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Holzmeister","given":"Felix"},{"family":"Ho","given":"Teck-Hua"},{"family":"Huber","given":"Jürgen"},{"family":"Johannesson","given":"Magnus"},{"family":"Kirchler","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Nave","given":"Gideon"},{"family":"Nosek","given":"Brian A."},{"family":"Pfeiffer","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Altmejd","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Buttrick","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Taizan"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yiling"},{"family":"Forsell","given":"Eskil"},{"family":"Gampa","given":"Anup"},{"family":"Heikensten","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Hummer","given":"Lily"},{"family":"Imai","given":"Taisuke"},{"family":"Isaksson","given":"Siri"},{"family":"Manfredi","given":"Dylan"},{"family":"Rose","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Wagenmakers","given":"Eric-Jan"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Hang"}],"citation-key":"camererEvaluatingReplicabilitySocial2018","container-title":"Nature Human Behaviour","DOI":"10.1038/s41562-018-0399-z","ISSN":"2397-3374","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9]]},"language":"en","number":"9","page":"637-644","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Evaluating the replicability of social science experiments in Nature and Science between 2010 and 2015","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0399-z","volume":"2"},

Based on our theoretical understanding of communicative practices, we found a discrepancy between the expectations of and the actual divergence from an ideal communicative environment free from distortion and manipulation that is normally assumed to govern online forums.

  {"id":"canchoLeastEffortOrigins2003","abstract":"The emergence of a complex language is one of the fundamental events of human evolution, and several remarkable features suggest the presence of fundamental principles of organization. These principles seem to be common to all languages. The best known is the so-called Zipf's law, which states that the frequency of a word decays as a (universal) power law of its rank. The possible origins of this law have been controversial, and its meaningfulness is still an open question. In this article, the early hypothesis of Zipf of a principle of least effort for explaining the law is shown to be sound. Simultaneous minimization in the effort of both hearer and speaker is formalized with a simple optimization process operating on a binary matrix of signal–object associations. Zipf's law is found in the transition between referentially useless systems and indexical reference systems. Our finding strongly suggests that Zipf's law is a hallmark of symbolic reference and not a meaningless feature. The implications for the evolution of language are discussed. We explain how language evolution can take advantage of a communicative phase transition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Cancho","given":"Ramon Ferrer","dropping-particle":"i"},{"family":"Solé","given":"Ricard V."}],"citation-key":"canchoLeastEffortOrigins2003","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0335980100","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,4,2]]},"language":"en","page":"788-791","PMID":"12540826","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Least effort and the origins of scaling in human language","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/100/3/788","volume":"100"},

We compute financial intermediation ratios for Japan (1979–2004) on a book value basis. According to our results, the intermediation ratio has remained quite stable, at around 85%. This stability is the result of two opposite trends: a decrease in credits and an increase in financial securities owned by financial (mostly, non-banking) institutions. These two trends are partly the consequence of the heavier weight of the Government in domestic external financing, which is traditionally less financed by credits than companies are. Besides, these two trends would not have appeared if we had used intermediation ratios in market value or other traditional indicators (Deposits/GDP, Loans to private sector/GDP, stock market capitalization/GDP, etc.). Our results provide evidence for a very close relationship between intermediate financings and market financings and tend to reject the hypothesis of the Japanese financial system's convergence toward a capital market-based system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Capelle-Blancard","given":"Gunther"},{"family":"Couppey-Soubeyran","given":"Jézabel"},{"family":"Soulat","given":"Laurent"}],"citation-key":"capelle-blancardMeasurementFinancialIntermediation2008","container-title":"Japan and the World Economy","container-title-short":"Japan and the World Economy","DOI":"10.1016/j.japwor.2006.08.005","ISSN":"0922-1425","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,1]]},"page":"40-60","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The measurement of financial intermediation in Japan","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142506000430","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"cappielloAsymmetricDynamicsCorrelations2006","abstract":"This paper proposes a new generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic (GARCH) process, the asymmetric generalized dynamic conditional correlation (AG-DCC) model. The AG-DCC process extends previous specifications along two dimensions: it allows for series-specific news impact and smoothing parameters and permits conditional asymmetries in correlation dynamics. The AG-DCC specification is well suited to examine correlation dynamics among different asset classes and investigate the presence of asymmetric responses in conditional variances and correlations to negative returns. We employ the AG-DCC model to analyze the behavior of international equities and government bonds. While equity returns show strong evidence of asymmetries in conditional volatility, little is found for bond returns. However, both equities and bonds exhibit asymmetries in conditional correlations, with equities responding stronger than bonds to joint bad news. The article also finds that, during periods of financial turmoil, equity market volatilities show important linkages, and conditional equity correlations among regional groups increase dramatically. Furthermore, in January 1999 with the introduction of the euro, we document significant evidence of a structural break in correlation although not in volatility. The introduction of a fixed exchange rate regime leads to near-perfect correlation among bond returns within the European Monetary Union (EMU) countries, which is not surprising when considering the harmonization in monetary policy. However, the increase in return correlation is not restricted to bond returns in EMU countries: equity return correlation both within and outside the EMU also increases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Cappiello","given":"Lorenzo"},{"family":"Engle","given":"Robert F."},{"family":"Sheppard","given":"Kevin"}],"citation-key":"cappielloAsymmetricDynamicsCorrelations2006","container-title":"Journal of Financial Econometrics","container-title-short":"JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMETRICS","DOI":"10.1093/jjfinec/nbl005","ISSN":"1479-8409, 1479-8417","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,9,21]]},"language":"en","page":"537-572","source":"jfec.oxfordjournals.org","title":"Asymmetric Dynamics in the Correlations of Global Equity and Bond Returns","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://jfec.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/4/537","volume":"4"},

Using Granger causality tests, I show that some of these measures have statistically significant prediction power with respect to the dynamics of aggregate stock market. Average path length is most robust relative to the frequency of data used or specification (index or growth rate). Most measures are found to have predictive power only for monthly frequency.

Besides the well-known correlation-based networks, we also use a specific tool for presenting causality in economics, the Granger causality. We consider different filtering methods to derive the stationary component of the GDP series for each of the countries in the samples. The networks were found to be sensitive to the detrending method. While the correlation networks provide information on comovement between the national economies, the Granger causality networks can better predict fluctuations in countries’ GDP. By using them, we can obtain directed networks allows us to determine the relative influence of different countries on the global economy network.

  {"id":"carrascosaQuantifyingEconomicCultural2015","abstract":"Online social media has recently irrupted as the last major venue for the propagation of news and cultural content, competing with traditional mass media and allowing citizens to access new sources of information. In this paper, we study collectively filtered news and popular content in Twitter, known as Trending Topics (TTs), to quantify the extent to which they show similar biases known for mass media. We use two datasets collected in 2013 and 2014, including more than 300.000 TTs from 62 countries. The existing patterns of leader-follower relationships among countries reveal systemic biases known for mass media: Countries concentrate their attention to small groups of other countries, generating a pattern of centralization in which TTs follow the gradient of wealth across countries. At the same time, we find subjective biases within language communities linked to the cultural similarity of countries, in which countries with closer cultures and shared languages tend to follow each other’s TTs. Moreover, using a novel methodology based on the Google News service, we study the influence of mass media in TTs for four countries. We find that roughly half of the TTs in Twitter overlap with news reported by mass media, and that the rest of TTs are more likely to spread internationally within Twitter. Our results confirm that online social media have the power to independently spread content beyond mass media, but at the same time social media content follows economic incentives and is subject to cultural factors and language barriers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Carrascosa","given":"Juan Miguel"},{"family":"Cuevas","given":"Ruben"},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Azcorra","given":"Arturo"},{"family":"Garcia","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"carrascosaQuantifyingEconomicCultural2015","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0134407","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,31]]},"page":"e0134407","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Quantifying the Economic and Cultural Biases of Social Media through Trending Topics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134407","volume":"10"},

Before the crisis, disintermediation and securitization changed how the U.S. financial system operated, as bank operations shifted from the traditional originate-and-hold model to originate-and-distribute. During the 1980s and 1990s, the overall size and profitability of the financial system grew as deregulation unleashed financial innovation and reorganization. Global shifts toward capital market integration and liberalization created greater global interdependence. Households in the years before the crisis also altered their relationship to the financial system, increasing debt loads and overall exposure to the stock market. Research reveals the importance of politics for many financial market developments, various implications for corporate governance, the continuing significance of social factors within finance, and the role of theoretical and material devices in shaping financial practices.

  {"id":"casarinBeingFieldWhen2013","abstract":"This paper looks at the relationship between negative news and stock markets in times of global crisis, such as the 2008/2009 period. We analysed one year of front page banner headlines of three financial newspapers, the Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, and Il Sole24ore to examine the influence of bad news both on stock market volatility and dynamic correlation. Our results show that the press and markets influenced each other in generating market volatility and in particular, that the Wall Street Journal had a crucial effect both on the volatility and correlation between the US and foreign markets. We also found significant differences between newspapers in their interpretation of the crisis, with the Financial Times being significantly pessimistic even in phases of low market volatility. Our results confirm the reflexive nature of stock markets. When the situation is uncertain and unpredictable, market behaviour may even reflect qualitative, big picture, and subjective information such as streamers in a newspaper, whose economic and informative value is questionable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Casarin","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Squazzoni","given":"Flaminio"}],"citation-key":"casarinBeingFieldWhen2013","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0067721","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,7,5]]},"page":"e67721","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Being on the Field When the Game Is Still Under Way.

  {"id":"castellsRiseNetworkSociety1996","abstract":"This book, the first in Castells' ground-breaking trilogy, is an account of the economic and social dynamics of the new age of information. Based on research in the USA, Asia, Latin America, and Europe, it aims to formulate a systematic theory of the information society which takes account of the fundamental effects of information technology on the contemporary world.The global economy is now characterized by the almost instantaneous flow and exchange of information, capital, and cultural communication. These flows order and condition both consumption and production. The networks themselves reflect and create distinctive cultures. Both they and the traffic they carry are largely outside national regulation. Our dependence on the new modes of informational flow gives enormous power to those in a position to control them to control us. The main political arena is now the media, and the media are not politically answerable.Manuel Castells describes the accelerating pace of innovation and social transformation. He examines the processes of globalization that threaten to make redundant whole countries and peoples excluded from informational networks. He investigates the culture, institutions, and organizations of the network enterprise and the concomitant transformation of work and employment. He shows that in the advanced economies production is now concentrated on an educated section of the population aged between 25 and 40. He suggests that the effect of this accelerating trend may not be mass unemployment but the extreme flexibilization of work and individualization of labor, and, in consequence, a highly segmented social structure.This new edition of The Rise of the Network Society has been substantially modified and details the new social and economic developments brought by the Internet and the 'new economy'. The volume has been updated throughout to take account of changes since its original publication.","author":[{"family":"Castells","given":"Manuel"}],"citation-key":"castellsRiseNetworkSociety1996","collection-title":"The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-631-22140-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1996]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"628","publisher":"Blackwell","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Google Books","title":"The Rise of The Network Society","title-short":"The Rise of The Network Society","type":"book","volume":"1"},

In recent years international migrationhas grown in volume, and is now an important factor of social transformation in all regions of the world. States classify migrants into certain categories, and seek to encourage certain types of mobility while restricting others. However,control measures are often ineffective if they are not based on understanding of the economic, social and cultural dynamics of migration. The article reviews causes and patterns of migration, and discusses some key issues: migration anddevelopment, international cooperation, settle-ment and ethnic diversity, and migration as a challenge to the nation-state. It is argued that most national governments have taken a short-term and reactive approach to migration. Effortsat international regulation are also relatively under-developed. There is a need for long-term cooperative strategies to achieve agreed goals such as: ensuring orderly migration and preventing exploitation by agents and recruiters;safeguarding the human rights of migrants; making migration an instrument of sustainable development; avoiding conflicts with populations of migrant-receiving areas, and maximising positive aspects of social and culturalchange.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Castles","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"castlesInternationalMigrationBeginining2000","container-title":"International Social Science Journal","DOI":"10.1111/1468-2451.00258","ISSN":"1468-2451","issue":"165","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"269-281","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"International Migration at the Beginining of the Twenty-First Century: Global Trends and Issues","title-short":"International Migration at the Beginining of the Twenty-First Century","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2451.00258/abstract","volume":"52"},

This study uses original panel data to examine behavioral and intentional persistence among students who enter an engineering major in college. Surprisingly, family plans do not contribute to women’s attrition during college but are negatively associated with men’s intentions to pursue an engineering career. Additionally, math self-assessment does not predict behavioral or intentional persistence once students enroll in a STEM major. This study introduces professional role confidence—individuals’ confidence in their ability to successfully fulfill the roles, competencies, and identity features of a profession—and argues that women’s lack of this confidence, compared to men, reduces their likelihood of remaining in engineering majors and careers. We find that professional role confidence predicts behavioral and intentional persistence, and that women’s relative lack of this confidence contributes to their attrition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Cech","given":"Erin"},{"family":"Rubineau","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Silbey","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Seron","given":"Caroll"}],"citation-key":"cechProfessionalRoleConfidence2011","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/0003122411420815","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"641-666","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Professional Role Confidence and Gendered Persistence in Engineering","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122411420815","volume":"76"},

The Oxford Handbook of the Sociology of Finance brings together twenty-nine chapters, written by scholars of international repute from Europe, North America, and Asia, to provide comprehensive coverage on a variety of topics related to the role of finance in a globalized world, and its historical development. Topics include global institutions of modern finance, types of actors involved in financial transactions and supporting technologies, mortgage markets, rating agencies, and the role of financial economics. Particular attention is given to financial crises, which are discussed in a special section, as well as to alternative forms of finance, including Islamic finance and the rise of China.

The model can be used to summarize a network of documents, predict links between them, and predict words within them.

The literature on violence and gangs has identified coping strategies that likely affect friendships, but most children in violent neighborhoods are not gang members, and not all friendship relations involve gangs. We examine the friendship-formation process based on in-depth interviews with 72 students, parents, and teachers in two elementary schools in violent Chicago neighborhoods. All students were African American boys and girls ages 11 to 15. We find that while conventional studies depict friendship formation among children as largely affective in nature, the process among the students we observed was, instead, primarily strategic. The children’s strategies were not singular but heterogeneous and malleable in nature. We identify and document five distinct strategies: protection seeking, avoidance, testing, cultivating questioners, and kin reliance. Girls were as affected as boys were, and they also reported additional preoccupations associated with sexual violence.

To fill this research gap, this study investigates these interconnected factors' influence on occupants’ IEQ-productivity belief, defined as a personal, subjective evaluation of the linkage between the impacts of five IEQ aspects (the quality of indoor temperature, air, natural and electric lighting, and acoustics) and productivity. A cross-sectional survey data was collected in university offices from six countries (Brazil, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan and the U.S.). Results of multiple linear regression models indicate that IEQ satisfaction is the strongest positive predictor of the IEQ-productivity belief and this relationship is stronger in private offices. Country of residence is the second primary predictor. Several attitudinal-behavioral factors, including thermal comfort, perceived ease of controlling indoor environmental features, and attitudes toward sharing controls are all positively associated with IEQ-productivity belief. Interestingly, the level of control accessibility to light switches has the strongest impact as opposed to other controls. On the other hand, group norms and conformity intention are not significant predictors. Regarding demographics, men are more likely than women to perceive the IEQs to have positive impacts on their productivity, without considering other variables in the regression model; however, women are more likely than men to consider all IEQs as having positive impacts on productivity, after considering other variables. Our findings provide suggestions for prioritizing wellness in the workplace since the early design stage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Chien-Fei"},{"family":"Yilmaz","given":"Selin"},{"family":"Pisello","given":"Anna Laura"},{"family":"De Simone","given":"Marilena"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Tianzhen"},{"family":"Bandurski","given":"Karol"},{"family":"Bavaresco","given":"Mateus V."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Pei-Ling"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Yimin"}],"citation-key":"chenImpactsBuildingCharacteristics2020","container-title":"Building and Environment","container-title-short":"Building and Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.107189","ISSN":"0360-1323","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"107189","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The impacts of building characteristics, social psychological and cultural factors on indoor environment quality productivity belief","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132320305618","volume":"185"},

The measure F is defined as the ratio between the number of pairs of nodes that are not connected in the fragmented network after removing a fraction q of nodes and the total number of pairs in the original fully connected network. We compare F with the traditional measure used in percolation theory, P(infinity), the fraction of nodes in the largest cluster relative to the total number of nodes. Using both analytical and numerical methods from percolation, we study Erdos-Rényi and scale-free networks under various types of node removal strategies. The removal strategies are random removal, high degree removal, and high betweenness centrality removal. We find that for a network obtained after removal (all strategies) of a fraction q of nodes above percolation threshold, P(infinity) approximately (1-F)1/2. For fixed P(infinity) and close to percolation threshold (q=qc), we show that 1-F better reflects the actual fragmentation. Close to qc, for a given P(infinity), 1-F has a broad distribution and it is thus possible to improve the fragmentation of the network. We also study and compare the fragmentation measure F and the percolation measure P(infinity) for a real social network of workplaces linked by the households of the employees and find similar results.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Yiping"},{"family":"Paul","given":"Gerald"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Reuven"},{"family":"Havlin","given":"Shlomo"},{"family":"Borgatti","given":"Stephen P."},{"family":"Liljeros","given":"Fredrik"},{"family":"Stanley","given":"H.

We train and calibrate the estimates using nationally representative household survey data from 56 LMICs and then validate their accuracy using four independent sources of household survey data from 18 countries. We also provide confidence intervals for each microestimate to facilitate responsible downstream use.

  {"id":"chingExtemporaneousCoordinationSpecialist2020","abstract":"Team production is ubiquitous in the economy, but managing teams effectively remains a challenge for many organizations. This paper studies how familiarity among teammates influences the performance of specialist teams, relative to nonspecialist teams. Applying theories of team production to contexts where team members coordinate interdependent activities extemporaneously, we develop predictions about factors that shift the marginal returns to specialization along two dimensions of familiarity: social familiarity and functional familiarity. We test our hypotheses in the context of Defence of the Ancients 2 (DOTA2), a major e-sports game where, in some formats, players are exogenously assigned to five-person teams. After analyzing nearly 6.5 million matches, we find that specialist teams are relatively more successful when members are more socially and functionally familiar with one another. The results suggest that the plug-and-play perspective on specialist teams is incomplete; rather, specialization and familiarity are complements in dynamic environments where team members coordinate extemporaneously.Funded: Financial support from the UCL School of Management and Worcester Polytechnic Institute is gratefully acknowledged.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Ching","given":"Kenny"},{"family":"Forti","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Rawley","given":"Evan"}],"citation-key":"chingExtemporaneousCoordinationSpecialist2020","container-title":"Organization Science","container-title-short":"Organization Science","DOI":"10.1287/orsc.2020.1376","ISSN":"1047-7039","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,7]]},"page":"1-17","publisher":"INFORMS","source":"pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon)","title":"Extemporaneous Coordination in Specialist Teams: The Familiarity Complementarity","title-short":"Extemporaneous Coordination in Specialist Teams","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/full/10.1287/orsc.2020.1376","volume":"32"},

The SES achievement gap has been documented across a wide range of countries. Yet in most countries, we do not know whether the SES achievement gap has been changing over time. This study combines 30 international large-scale assessments over 50 years, representing 100 countries and about 5.8 million students. SES achievement gaps are computed between the 90th and 10th percentiles of three available measures of family SES: parents’ education, parents’ occupation, and the number of books in the home. Results indicate that, for each of the three SES variables examined, achievement gaps increased in a majority of sample countries. Yet there is substantial cross-national variation in the size of increases in SES achievement gaps. The largest increases are observed in countries with rapidly increasing school enrollments, implying that expanding access reveals educational inequality that was previously hidden outside the school system. However, gaps also increased in many countries with consistently high enrollments, suggesting that cognitive skills are an increasingly important dimension of educational stratification worldwide.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Chmielewski","given":"Anna K."}],"citation-key":"chmielewskiGlobalIncreaseSocioeconomic2019","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/0003122419847165","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"517-544","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Global Increase in the Socioeconomic Achievement Gap, 1964 to 2015","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122419847165","volume":"84"},

  {"id":"chuaImpactCultureCreativity2015","abstract":"This paper advances a new theoretical model to understand the effect of culture on creativity in a global context. We theorize that creativity engagement and success depend on the cultural tightness—the extent to which a country is characterized by strong social norms and low tolerance for deviant behaviors—of both an innovator’s country and the audience’s country, as well as the cultural distance between these two countries. Using field data from a global online crowdsourcing platform that organizes creative contests for consumer-product brands, supplemented by interviews with marketing experts, we found that individuals from tight cultures are less likely than counterparts from loose cultures to engage in and succeed at foreign creative tasks; this effect is intensified as the cultural distance between the innovator’s and the audience’s country increases. Additionally, tight cultures are less receptive to foreign creative ideas. But we also found that in certain circumstances—when members of a tight culture do creative work in their own or culturally close countries—cultural tightness can actually promote creativity success. This finding implies that some degree of convergent thinking as engendered by tight cultures could be beneficial for creativity, challenging the dominant view in creativity research that divergent thinking is a prerequisite for creative performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Chua","given":"Roy Y.

We perform a comparative analysis of more than 100 million pieces of content concerning several controversial topics (e.g., gun control, vaccination, abortion) from Gab, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. We quantify echo chambers over social media by two main ingredients: 1) homophily in the interaction networks and 2) bias in the information diffusion toward like-minded peers.

These theoretical approaches, Clough suggests, have become the vehicles of unconscious thought in our time.In individual chapters, Clough juxtaposes the likes of Derridean deconstruction, Deleuzian philosophy, and Lacanian psychoanalysis. She works through the writings of Fredric Jameson, Donna Haraway, Judith Butler, Bruno Latour, Nancy Fraser, Elizabeth Grosz -- to name only a few -- placing all in dialogue with a teletechnological framework. Clough shows how these cultural criticisms have raised questions about the foundation of thought, allowing us to reenvision the relationship of nature and technology, the human and the machine, the virtual and the real, the living and the inert.","author":[{"family":"Clough","given":"Patricia Ticineto"}],"citation-key":"cloughAutoaffectionUnconsciousThought2000","ISBN":"978-0-8166-2889-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"232","publisher":"University of MINNESOTA Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Autoaffection: Unconscious Thought in the Age of Teletechnology","title-short":"Autoaffection","type":"book"},

  {"id":"cocciaEvolutionConvergencePatterns2016","abstract":"International research collaboration plays an important role in the social construction and evolution of science. Studies of science increasingly analyze international collaboration across multiple organizations for its impetus in improving research quality, advancing efficiency of the scientific production, and fostering breakthroughs in a shorter time. However, long-run patterns of international research collaboration across scientific fields and their structural changes over time are hardly known. Here we show the convergence of international scientific collaboration across research fields over time. Our study uses a dataset by the National Science Foundation and computes the fraction of papers that have international institutional coauthorships for various fields of science. We compare our results with pioneering studies carried out in the 1970s and 1990s by applying a standardization method that transforms all fractions of internationally coauthored papers into a comparable framework. We find, over 1973–2012, that the evolution of collaboration patterns across scientific disciplines seems to generate a convergence between applied and basic sciences. We also show that the general architecture of international scientific collaboration, based on the ranking of fractions of international coauthorships for different scientific fields per year, has tended to be unchanged over time, at least until now. Overall, this study shows, to our knowledge for the first time, the evolution of the patterns of international scientific collaboration starting from initial results described by literature in the 1970s and 1990s. We find a convergence of these long-run collaboration patterns between the applied and basic sciences. This convergence might be one of contributing factors that supports the evolution of modern scientific fields.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Coccia","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lili"}],"citation-key":"cocciaEvolutionConvergencePatterns2016","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1510820113","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,23]]},"language":"en","page":"2057-2061","PMID":"26831098","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Evolution and convergence of the patterns of international scientific collaboration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/113/8/2057","volume":"113"},
  {"id":"cohenClassifyingPoliticalOrientation2013","abstract":"Numerous papers have reported great success at inferring the political orientation of Twitter users.  This paper has some unfortunate news to deliver: while past work has been sound and often methodologically novel, we have discovered that reported accuracies have been systemically overoptimistic due to the way in which validation datasets have been collected, reporting accuracy levels nearly 30% higher than can be expected in populations of general Twitter users. Using careful and novel data collection and annotation techniques, we collected three different sets of Twitter users, each characterizing a different degree of political engagement on Twitter - from politicians (highly politically vocal) to \"normal\" users (those who rarely discuss politics).  Applying standard techniques for inferring political orientation, we show that methods which previously reported greater than 90% inference accuracy, actually achieve barely 65% accuracy on normal users. We also show that classifiers cannot be used to classify users outside the narrow range of political orientation on which they were trained. While a sobering finding, our results quantify and call attention to overlooked problems in the latent attribute inference literature that, no doubt, extend beyond political orientation inference: the way in which datasets are assembled and the transferability of classifiers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Cohen","given":"Raviv"},{"family":"Ruths","given":"Derek"}],"citation-key":"cohenClassifyingPoliticalOrientation2013","container-title":"Seventh International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media","event":"Seventh International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media","event-place":"Palo Alto, CA","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,6,28]]},"language":"en","page":"91-99","publisher-place":"Palo Alto, CA","source":"www.aaai.org","title":"Classifying Political Orientation on Twitter: It’s Not Easy!","title-short":"Classifying Political Orientation on Twitter","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM13/paper/view/6128"},

While this method is increasingly applied in congruence research, its complexity relative to other methods for assessing congruence (e.g., difference score methods) was one of the main claims against its use. The objective of this work is to gain additional insight into the use of polynomial regression in the area of social and behavioral sciences. First, we elaborate on the meaning and the inference based on the coefficients obtained by applying polynomial regression and explain the mathematical terms that are used to describe response surfaces. Then, we introduce additional inference methods and illustrate their application on a real life example from the area of supportive exchanges, using data collected by the Smithers Institute at Cornell University (supported by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism).

  {"id":"coleHierarchySciences1983","abstract":"For 200 years it has been assumed that the sciences are arranged in a hierarchy, with developed natural sciences like physics at the top and social sciences like sociology at the bottom. Sciences at the top of the hierarchy presumably display higher levels of consensus and more rapid rates of advancement than those at the bottom. A distinction is made between two classes of knowledge: the core, or fully evaluated and universally accepted ideas which serve as the starting points for graduate education, and the research frontier, or all research currently being conducted. Data are presented from a set of empirical studies which show that, at the top and at the bottom of the hierarchy in either cognitive consensus or the rate at which new ideas are incorporated. It is concluded that in all sciences knowledge at the research frontier is a loosely woven web characterized by substantial levels of disagreement and difficulty in determining which contributions will turn out to be significant. Even at the research frontier, however, minimal levels of consensus are a necessary condition for the accumulation of knowledge. Consensus in all sciences is maintained by sociological processes such as the evaluation and reward systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Cole","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"coleHierarchySciences1983","container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","container-title-short":"American Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1086/227835","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1983,7,1]]},"page":"111-139","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"The Hierarchy of the Sciences?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/227835","volume":"89"},

The result is a landmark in sociological theory, capable of describing both stability and change in social systems.This book provides for the first time a sound theoretical foundation for linking the behavior of individuals to organizational behavior and then to society as a whole. The power of the theory is especially apparent when Coleman analyzes corporate actors, such as large corporations and trade unions. He examines the creation of these institutions, collective decision making, and the processes through which authority is revoked in revolts and revolutions.Coleman discusses the problems of holding institutions responsible for their actions as well as their incompatibility with the family. He also provides a simple mathematical analysis corresponding to and carrying further the verbal formulations of the theory. Finally, he generates research techniques that will permit quantitative testing of the theory.From a simple, unified conceptual structure Coleman derives, through elegant chains of reasoning, an encompassing theory of society. It promises to be the most important contribution to social theory since the publication of Talcott Parsons' Structure of Social Action in 1936.","author":[{"family":"Coleman","given":"James Samuel"}],"citation-key":"colemanFoundationsSocialTheory1990","event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-0-674-31225-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[1990]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"1028","publisher":"Belknap of Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"Google Books","title":"Foundations of Social Theory","type":"book"},

  {"id":"coleWhatWrongSociology2001","abstract":"Since the 1950s sociology has experienced a decline in prestige when compared with the other social sciences. In some highly publicized cases some universities have retrenched their sociology departments, others are contemplating either retrenchment or downsizing of their departments. Although there are some practitioners of the discipline who believe that it has never been in better shape, many sociologists have come to believe that there are very serious problems both in the cognitive and social organization of the discipline. This book contains sixteen essays by sociologists who believe that their discipline faces very serious problems which must be overcome if the discipline is to survive and prosper. The contributors were selected to represent diverse views and thus there is substantial disagreement among them over what the problems are that sociology faces and how they may be remedied. In this highly provocative book readers is likely to find some essays they agree with and others they disagree with; but all the essays present important problems faced by the discipline which must be addressed.  Although the authors of the sixteen essays do not agree on what is wrong with the discipline, there are some themes which appear frequently. In his introduction Cole summarizes and comments on these themes. His introduction centers on the question of whether sociology is entirely socially constructed. Is what we believe to be true about society constrained by empirical evidence or is it a result of our ideology, power, authority, and other social processes? One theme which appears in many of the essays is that sociology has become too ideological and as a result has lost credibility among university administrators, politicians and the general public. Many of the essays also stress the view that there are very low levels of consensus in sociology and that it is hard to see evidence of progress. Others criticize the discipline for not dealing with the really important social issues and see much of the work published as being parochial and trivial. Questions are also raised about why the use of causal models has failed to generate solutions to most of the problems the discipline addresses. Some authors believe that the discipline adheres to an overly rational model of human behavior and has failed to keep up with some of the advances introduced by post-modernist theories.  This highly readable set of essays should be of interest to all those are concerned about the current state of sociology. They will also be useful in introducing graduate students to some of the most important issues currently being debated in the field.  Stephen Cole is currently professor of sociology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and professor of sociology at the University of Queensland, Australia. He is the author of Making Science: Between Nature and Society, and with Jonathan R.

Both the touting of new quantitative methodologies and the antipositivism of opposing camps tend to operate as ideologies for particular specialties and to obscure the substantive advances that are possible. A number of areas in which creative work is likely to go on in the next 10 years are sketched: historical change; emotion versus cognition; the micro-macro connection; an integrated theory of organizations, networks, and markets; and sex and gender.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Collins","given":"Randall"}],"citation-key":"collins1980sSociologyDoldrums1986","container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1086/228424","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[1986,5,1]]},"page":"1336-1355","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Is 1980s Sociology in the Doldrums?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/228424","volume":"91"},

  {"id":"colmanEfficientSentinelSurveillance2019","abstract":"Surveillance plays a crucial role in preventing emerging infectious diseases from becoming epidemic. In circumstances where it is possible to monitor the infection status of certain people, transport hubs, or hospitals, early detection of the disease allows interventions to be implemented before most of the damage can occur, or at least its impact can be mitigated. This paper addresses the question of which nodes we should select in a network of individuals susceptible to some infectious disease in order to minimize the number of casualties. By simulating disease outbreaks on a collection of empirical and synthetic networks we show that the best strategy depends on topological characteristics of the network. For highly modular or spatially embedded networks it is better to place the sentinels on nodes distributed across different regions. However, if the degree heterogeneity is high, then a strategy that targets network hubs is preferred. We further consider the consequences of having an incomplete sample of the network and demonstrate that the value of new information diminishes as more data is collected. Finally we find further marginal improvements using two heuristics informed by known results in graph theory that exploit the fragmented structure of sparse network data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Colman","given":"Ewan"},{"family":"Holme","given":"Petter"},{"family":"Sayama","given":"Hiroki"},{"family":"Gershenson","given":"Carlos"}],"citation-key":"colmanEfficientSentinelSurveillance2019","container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007517","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,25]]},"language":"en","page":"e1007517","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Efficient sentinel surveillance strategies for preventing epidemics on networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007517","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"conradSocialMediaAlternative2019","abstract":"There is interest in using social media content to supplement or even substitute for survey data. In one of the studies to test the feasibility of this idea, O’Connor, Balasubramanyan, Routledge, and Smith report reasonably high correlations between the sentiment of tweets containing the word “jobs” and survey-based measures of consumer confidence in 2008–2009. Other researchers report a similar relationship through 2011, but after that time it is no longer observed, suggesting such tweets may not be as promising an alternative to survey responses as originally hoped. But, it’s possible that with the right analytic techniques, the sentiment of “jobs” tweets might still be an acceptable alternative. To explore this, we first classify “jobs” tweets into categories whose content is either related to employment or not, to see whether sentiment of the former correlates more highly with a survey-based measure of consumer sentiment. We then compare the relationship when sentiment is determined with traditional dictionary-based methods versus newer machine learning-based tools developed for Twitter-like texts. We calculated daily sentiment in three different ways and used a measure of association less sensitive to outliers than correlation. None of these approaches improved the size of the relationship in the original or more recent data. We found that the many micro-decisions these analyses require, such as the size of the smoothing interval and the length of the lag between the two series, can significantly affect the outcomes. In the end, despite the earlier promise of tweets as an alternative to survey responses, we find no evidence that the original relationship in these data was more than a chance occurrence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Conrad","given":"Frederick G."},{"family":"Gagnon-Bartsch","given":"Johann A."},{"family":"Ferg","given":"Robyn A."},{"family":"Schober","given":"Michael F."},{"family":"Pasek","given":"Josh"},{"family":"Hou","given":"Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"conradSocialMediaAlternative2019","container-title":"Social Science Computer Review","container-title-short":"Social Science Computer Review","DOI":"10.1177/0894439319875692","ISSN":"0894-4393","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,26]]},"language":"en","page":"0894439319875692","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Social Media as an Alternative to Surveys of Opinions About the Economy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439319875692"},

The breakthrough rate depends on the rate at which an inventor generates inventions and the probability that each of these inventions is a breakthrough. We argue that inventors with larger patent records generate a higher rate of inventions, but the single inventions that they generate each have a lower probability of being a breakthrough. Longitudinal data of 5,144 European inventors and fixed-effects estimation confirm these predictions and reveal that the net effect of the inventors’ stock of past inventions on the breakthrough rate is positive—that is, more established inventors display a higher rate of breakthroughs than brand-new inventors. We also confirm the role of organizational contexts in shaping inventors’ productivity. In particular, firms’ control over research and development targets lessens the advantage of established inventors with regard to the rate of breakthrough generation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Conti","given":"Raffaele"},{"family":"Gambardella","given":"Alfonso"},{"family":"Mariani","given":"Myriam"}],"citation-key":"contiLearningBeEdison2013","container-title":"Organization Science","container-title-short":"Organization Science","DOI":"10.1287/orsc.2013.0875","ISSN":"1047-7039","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,23]]},"page":"833-849","publisher":"INFORMS","source":"pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon)","title":"Learning to Be Edison: Inventors, Organizations, and Breakthrough Inventions","title-short":"Learning to Be Edison","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2013.0875","volume":"25"},

We study alternative models of diffusion on networks and we calibrate them using input-output data on real-world inter-sectoral dependencies for several European countries before the Great Depression. We show that the impact of economic shocks strongly depends on the nature of the shock and country size. Shocks that impact on final demand without changing production and the technological relationships between sectors have on average a large but very homogeneous impact on the economy. Conversely, when shocks change also the magnitudes of input-output across-sector interdependencies (and possibly sector production), the economy is subject to predominantly large but more heterogeneous avalanche sizes. In this case, we also find that (i) the more a sector is globally central in the country network, the larger its impact; (ii) the largest European countries, such as those constituting the core of the European Union's economy, typically experience the largest avalanches, signaling their intrinsic higher vulnerability to economic shocks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Contreras","given":"Martha G.

  {"id":"copelandDifferentKindsLonely2018","abstract":"Social isolation is broadly associated with poor mental health and risky behaviors in adolescence, a time when peers are critical for healthy development. However, expectations for isolates’ substance use remain unclear. Isolation in adolescence may signal deviant attitudes or spur self-medication, resulting in higher substance use. Conversely, isolates may lack access to substances, leading to lower use. Although treated as a homogeneous social condition for teens in much research, isolation represents a multifaceted experience with structurally distinct network components that present different risks for substance use. This study decomposes isolation into conceptually distinct dimensions that are then interacted to create a systematic typology of isolation subtypes representing different positions in the social space of the school. Each isolated position’s association with cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use is tested among 9th grade students (n = 10,310, 59% female, 83% white) using cross-sectional data from the PROSPER study. Different dimensions of isolation relate to substance use in distinct ways: unliked isolation is associated with lower alcohol use, whereas disengagement and outside orientation are linked to higher use of all three substances. Specifically, disengagement presents risks for cigarette and marijuana use among boys, and outside orientation is associated with cigarette use for girls. Overall, the adolescents disengaged from their school network who also identify close friends outside their grade are at greatest risk for substance use. This study indicates the importance of considering the distinct social positions of isolation to understand risks for both substance use and social isolation in adolescence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Copeland","given":"Molly"},{"family":"Fisher","given":"Jacob C."},{"family":"Moody","given":"James"},{"family":"Feinberg","given":"Mark E."}],"citation-key":"copelandDifferentKindsLonely2018","container-title":"Journal of Youth and Adolescence","container-title-short":"J Youth Adolescence","DOI":"10.1007/s10964-018-0860-3","ISSN":"1573-6601","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1755-1770","source":"Springer Link","title":"Different Kinds of Lonely: Dimensions of Isolation and Substance Use in Adolescence","title-short":"Different Kinds of Lonely","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10964-018-0860-3","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"correllBlackBoxOrganizational2020","abstract":"Organizations implement formalized procedures to eliminate the biasing effects of gender and other characteristics on evaluations. Prior work shows managers play a key role, but researchers have been unable to observe the thought processes guiding managers’ evaluations. This article takes a first step in examining managers’ sensemaking as they interpret and evaluate employee behaviors. Our data include managers’ written performance reviews and numeric ratings of employees at a Fortune 500 technology company. Our theoretical model—the Viewing and Valuing Social Cognitive Processing Model—explains how and when gender beliefs frame managers’ evaluations, affecting what behaviors managers notice (i.e., view) and rate highly (i.e., value). After conducting a detailed coding of the language in reviews, we assess whether there are gender differences in (1) the language used to describe performance (i.e., viewing differences) and (2) the correlations between that language and numeric ratings (i.e., valuing differences). Our analysis of 88 language attributes reveals where gender frames managers’ evaluations and where the process instead operates gender-neutrally. For example, men and women are equally likely to be described as having technical ability, while women are viewed as too aggressive and men as too soft. Furthermore, some behaviors, such as “taking charge,” are more valued for men than for women: “taking charge” is associated with the highest performance ratings for men but not for women. Overall, our analysis identifies novel ways that gender biases emerge in a process intended to be meritocratic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Correll","given":"Shelley J."},{"family":"Weisshaar","given":"Katherine R."},{"family":"Wynn","given":"Alison T."},{"family":"Wehner","given":"JoAnne Delfino"}],"citation-key":"correllBlackBoxOrganizational2020","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/0003122420962080","ISSN":"0003-1224","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,12]]},"language":"en","page":"0003122420962080","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Inside the Black Box of Organizational Life: The Gendered Language of Performance Assessment","title-short":"Inside the Black Box of Organizational Life","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122420962080"},
  {"id":"correllItConventionalThought2017","abstract":"A core claim of sociological theory is that modern institutions fall short of their meritocratic ideals, whereby rewards should be allocated based on achievement-related criteria. Instead, high-status actors often experience a “status advantage”: they are rewarded disproportionately to the quality of their performance. We develop and test a theory of status advantage in meritocratic settings. The most influential model in past research derives status advantage from decision-makers’ tendency to infer quality from status when quality is uncertain. The theory developed here integrates and extends this and other theories to explain the emergence of status advantage in the many meritocratic contexts where the decision-maker’s personal, first-order sense of quality is less important to the decision. We argue that in such contexts, decision-makers must often coordinate with others to make the “best” decision, and thus they focus on the “third-order inference” problem of discerning who or what “most people” think is higher quality, as encoded in status beliefs. Three experiments demonstrate that under such conditions, status advantages can emerge even though (1) status information does not resolve uncertainty about quality; (2) the status belief is illegitimate; and (3) no party to the decision personally prefers the higher-status option. The theory implies that status hierarchies are resilient in the face of significant dissent but may be subject to public challenge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Correll","given":"Shelley J."},{"family":"Ridgeway","given":"Cecilia L."},{"family":"Zuckerman","given":"Ezra W."},{"family":"Jank","given":"Sharon"},{"family":"Jordan-Bloch","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"Sandra"}],"citation-key":"correllItConventionalThought2017","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/0003122417691503","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"297-327","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"It’s the Conventional Thought That Counts: How Third-Order Inference Produces Status Advantage","title-short":"It’s the Conventional Thought That Counts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122417691503","volume":"82"},

Cultural diversity is commonly thought to present a tradeoff between task coordination and creative problem solving, with diversity arising primarily through cultural differences between individuals. In contrast, we propose that diversity can also exist within persons when individuals hold multiple cultural beliefs about the organization. We refer to these different forms as interpersonal and intrapersonal cultural heterogeneity. We argue that the former tends to undermine coordination and portends worsening firm profitability, while the latter facilitates creativity and supports greater patenting success and more positive market valuations. To evaluate these propositions, we use computational linguistics to identify cultural content in employee reviews of nearly 500 publicly traded firms on a leading company review website and then develop novel, time-varying measures of cultural heterogeneity. Our empirical results lend support for our two core propositions, suggesting the need to rethink the performance tradeoffs of cultural heterogeneity: it may be possible to reap the creativity benefits of higher intrapersonal heterogeneity and, at the same time, the efficiency benefits of lower interpersonal heterogeneity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Corritore","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Amir"},{"family":"Srivastava","given":"Sameer B."}],"citation-key":"corritoreDualityDiversityHow2020a","container-title":"Administrative Science Quarterly","container-title-short":"Administrative Science Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/0001839219844175","ISSN":"0001-8392","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"359-394","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Duality in Diversity: How Intrapersonal and Interpersonal Cultural Heterogeneity Relate to Firm Performance","title-short":"Duality in Diversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0001839219844175","volume":"65"},

The analysis, discrimination, and synthesis of complex networks therefore rely on the use of measurements capable of expressing the most relevant topological features. This article presents a survey of such measurements. It includes general considerations about complex network characterization, a brief review of the principal models, and the presentation of the main existing measurements. Important related issues covered in this work comprise the representation of the evolution of complex networks in terms of trajectories in several measurement spaces, the analysis of the correlations between some of the most traditional measurements, perturbation analysis, as well as the use of multivariate statistics for feature selection and network classification. Depending on the network and the analysis task one has in mind, a specific set of features may be chosen.

The team is considered a network with players as nodes and passes as (directed) edges. A temporal analysis of the resulting passes network is also done, looking at the number of passes, length of the chain of passes, and to network measures such as player centrality and clustering coefficient. Results of the last three matches (the decisive ones) indicate that the clustering coefficient of the pass network remains high, indicating the elaborate style of the Spanish team. The effectiveness of the opposing team in negating the Spanish game is reflected in the change of several network measures over time, most importantly in drops of the clustering coefficient and passing length/speed, as well as in their being able in removing the most talented players from the central positions of the network. Spain’s ability to restore their combinative game and move the focus of the game to offensive positions and talented players is shown to tilt the balance in favor of the Spanish team.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Cotta","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Mora","given":"Antonio M."},{"family":"Merelo","given":"Juan Julián"},{"family":"Merelo-Molina","given":"Cecilia"}],"citation-key":"cottaNetworkAnalysis20102013","container-title":"Journal of Systems Science and Complexity","container-title-short":"J Syst Sci Complex","DOI":"10.1007/s11424-013-2291-2","ISSN":"1009-6124, 1559-7067","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"21-42","source":"link.springer.com","title":"A network analysis of the 2010 FIFA world cup champion team play","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-013-2291-2","volume":"26"},

A university’s prestige is an emergent property of hiring interactions, so we use a network perspective to measure it. Using this emergent ordering, we compare the subsequent scientific performance of scholars with different changes in the prestige hierarchy. We ask how movements between universities of different prestige from Ph.D. to first job correlates with academic performance. We use data of South African scholars from 1970 to 2012 and we find that those who make large movements in terms of prestige have lower research ratings than those who do not.

First, we review the central benefits of this under-utilized approach from a perspective uncommon in the existing literature: we focus on how predictive modeling can be used to complement and augment standard associational analyses. Second, we advance the state of the literature by laying out a simple set of benchmark predictive criteria.

This crisis is the latest phase of the evolution of financial markets under the radical financial deregulation process that began in the late 1970s. This evolution has taken the form of cycles in which deregulation accompanied by rapid financial innovation stimulates powerful financial booms that end in crises. Governments respond to crises with bailouts that allow new expansions to begin. As a result, financial markets have become ever larger and financial crises have become more threatening to society, which forces governments to enact ever larger bailouts. This process culminated in the current global financial crisis, which is so deeply rooted that even unprecedented interventions by affected governments have, thus far, failed to contain it.

In contrast to previous studies investigating similar research questions, our approach allows to differentiate changes along various immigrant characteristics. Derived from discussions making up the German immigration discourse during this time, we expect reduced acceptance especially of those immigrants who were explicitly connected to the salient events, like Muslims and the offenders of NYE. Most strikingly, we find that refugees were generally highly accepted and even more so in the second wave, whereas the acceptance of immigrants from Arab or African countries further decreased. Moreover, female respondents’ initial preference for male immigrants disappeared. Contrary to our expectations, we find no changes in the acceptance of Muslims. We conclude that (i) public opinion research is well advised to match the particular political and social context under investigation to a fitting outcome variable to adequately capture the dynamics of anti-immigrant sentiment and that (ii) the vividly discussed upper limits for refugees seem to be contrary to public demands according to our data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Czymara","given":"Christian S."},{"family":"Schmidt-Catran","given":"Alexander W."}],"citation-key":"czymaraRefugeesUnwelcomeChanges","container-title":"European Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Eur Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1093/esr/jcx071","source":"academic.oup.com","title":"Refugees Unwelcome?

We highlight six factors: shared organizational foci, shared traits and interests, tie advantages from popularity, tie reinforcement from third parties, tie strength and multiplexity, and the instrumental returns from the products of ties. Findings suggest that ties form when unfamiliar people identify desirable and matching traits in potential partners. By contrast, ties persist when familiar people reflect on the quality of their relationship and shared experiences. The former calls for shallow, short-term strategies for assessing a broad array of potential ties; the latter calls for long-term strategies and substantive assessments of a relationship’s worth so as to draw extended rewards from the association. This suggests that organizational activities geared toward sustaining persistent intraorganizational task relationships need to be different from activities aimed at forging new ones.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Dahlander","given":"Linus"},{"family":"McFarland","given":"Daniel A."}],"citation-key":"dahlanderTiesThatLast2013","container-title":"Administrative Science Quarterly","container-title-short":"Administrative Science Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/0001839212474272","ISSN":"0001-8392, 1930-3815","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"69-110","source":"asq.sagepub.com","title":"Ties That Last Tie Formation and Persistence in Research Collaborations over Time","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://asq.sagepub.com/content/58/1/69","volume":"58"},

  {"id":"damatoInfluenceDescriptionLogics2008","abstract":"Similarity measures play a key role in the Semantic Web perspective. Indeed, most of the ontology related operations such as ontology learning, ontology alignment, ontology ranking and ontology population are grounded on the notion of similarity. In the last few years several similarity functions have been proposed for measuring both concept similarity and ontology similarity. However, they lack of a comprehensive formal characterization that is able to explain their behavior and value added, in particular when the ontologies are formulated in description logics languages like OWL-DL. Concept similarity functions need to be able to deal with the high expressive power of the ontology representation language, and to convey the underlying semantics of the ontology to which concepts refer. We propose a semantic similarity measure for complex Description Logics concept descriptions that elicits the underlying ontology semantics. Furthermore, we theorize a set of criteria that a measure has to satisfy in order to be compliant with a semantic expected behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Amato","given":"Claudia","non-dropping-particle":"d’"},{"family":"Staab","given":"Steffen"},{"family":"Fanizzi","given":"Nicola"}],"citation-key":"damatoInfluenceDescriptionLogics2008","collection-number":"5268","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"Knowledge Engineering: Practice and Patterns","editor":[{"family":"Gangemi","given":"Aldo"},{"family":"Euzenat","given":"Jérôme"}],"ISBN":"978-3-540-87695-3 978-3-540-87696-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"en","page":"48-63","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","source":"link.springer.com","title":"On the Influence of Description Logics Ontologies on Conceptual Similarity","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-87696-0_7"},

First, research output on a given country increases with the country's population and wealth, yielding a strong correlation between per-capita research output and per-capita GDP. Regressions controlling for data quality, governance and the use of English give an estimated research–wealth elasticity of 0.32; surprisingly, the U.S. is not an outlier. Second, papers written about the U.S. are 2.5 percentage-points more likely to be published in the top five economics journals after accounting for authors' institutional affiliations and the field of study. This is a large effect because only 1.5% of all papers written about countries other than the U.S. are published in first-tier journals.

  {"id":"daviesWhenNeighboringDisciplines2018","abstract":"As knowledge production becomes more specialized, studying complex and multi-faceted empirical realities becomes more difficult. This has created a growing need for cross-fertilization and collaboration between research disciplines. According to prior studies, the sharing of concepts, ideas and empirical domains with other disciplines may promote cross-fertilization. We challenge this one-sided view. Based on an analysis of the parallel development of the neighboring disciplines of innovation studies and project management, we show that the sharing of concepts and empirical domains can have ambivalent effects. Under conditions of ideological distancing, shared concepts and domains will be narrowly assimilated − an effect we call ‘encapsulation’ – which creates an illusion of sharing, while promoting further self-containment. By comparison, reflexive meta-theories and cross-disciplinary community-building will enable a form of sharing that promotes cross-fertilization. Our findings inform research on research specialization, cross-fertilization and effectiveness of interdisciplinary collaboration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Davies","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Manning","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Söderlund","given":"Jonas"}],"citation-key":"daviesWhenNeighboringDisciplines2018","container-title":"Research Policy","container-title-short":"Research Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.respol.2018.03.002","ISSN":"0048-7333","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,1]]},"page":"965-979","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"When neighboring disciplines fail to learn from each other: The case of innovation and project management research","title-short":"When neighboring disciplines fail to learn from each other","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733318300520","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"davisDeclineFallConglomerate1994a","abstract":"In 1980, the conglomerate firm, a firm composed of several unrelated businesses, was perhaps the dominant corporate form in the United States. Yet, by 1990 this form had in effect become deinstitutionalized. Using comprehensive time-series data from the 1980s on a population of the largest industrial firms in the United States, we demonstrate that this deinstitutionalization was effected by two processes: First, diversified firms were taken over at a high rate and their unwanted parts were typically sold off, and second, the less diversified firms that survived shunned the strategy of conglomerate growth. The aggregate result was that by 1990 the largest industrial firms in the United States became considerably less diversified. Business rhetoric tracked the shift in this prevalent organizational form and practice by denouncing the \"firm-as-portfolio\" model in favor of a network model of regularized economic exchange. We argue that an unintended consequence of the successful spread of the conglomerate form was to replace the conceptualization of the corporation as a sovereign actor with a reductionist view of the firm as a network without boundaries or a nexus-of-contracts among separate individuals. We discuss the implications of this conceptualization for organization theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Davis","given":"Gerald F."},{"family":"Diekmann","given":"Kristina A."},{"family":"Tinsley","given":"Catherine H."}],"citation-key":"davisDeclineFallConglomerate1994a","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.2307/2095931","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1994,8,1]]},"page":"547-570","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Decline and Fall of the Conglomerate Firm in the 1980s: The Deinstitutionalization of an Organizational Form","title-short":"The Decline and Fall of the Conglomerate Firm in the 1980s","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2095931","volume":"59"},

It is shown that corporate debt issuance is positively correlated with mergers and acquisitions and with industrial production, taken as a proxy of investment expenditures or working capital. Substitution with other sources of finance is shown to be related to cost differentials. The timing and size of these explanatory factors of corporate debt securities issuance differ across maturity. The empirical findings also show that corporate bond spreads lag short-term interest rates and lead real economic activity.

One widespread weakness within this literature has been its static analysis and bias toward predicting institutional stability rather than change. Our contention is that introducing more dynamism into this literature must proceed on three distinct levels: the micro, meso and macro. On the micro level, it needs to develop a less deterministic view of institutions that incorporates a stronger understanding of how actors reshape institutions, not only as constraints on particular courses of action, but also as resources for new courses of action that (incrementally) transform those institutions. On the meso-level, it needs to specify more carefully the linkages among institutions and institutional domains and theorize how change in one affects change in the other. At the macro level, it needs to incorporate a compelling view of national and international politics that draws upon a theory of coalitional dynamics and the impact of particular rule-making processes that governs institutional reform in each nation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Deeg","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Gregory"}],"citation-key":"deegMoreDynamicTheory2007","container-title":"Socio-Economic Review","container-title-short":"Socioecon Rev","DOI":"10.1093/ser/mwl021","ISSN":"1475-1461, 1475-147X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"149-179","source":"ser.oxfordjournals.org","title":"Towards a more dynamic theory of capitalist variety","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ser.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/1/149","volume":"5"},

As a result, the 1970s witnessed a radicalization of sociology, but the 1980s saw a general decline of sociology. Upon a resurgence during the 1990s, the crisis advocates have come back with a vengeance in the form of a renewed commitment to a heavily politicized sociology under the heading of public sociology, a perspective that is now thoroughly institutionalized and widely embraced.

  {"id":"delcastilloExponentialRandomGraph2020","abstract":"Faculty hiring networks consist of academic departments in a particular field (vertices) and directed edges from the departments that award Ph.D. degrees to students to the institutions that hires them as faculty. Study of these networks has been used in the past to find a hierarchy, or ranking, among departments, but they can also help reveal sociological aspects of a profession that have consequences in the dissemination of educational innovations and knowledge. In this article, we propose to use a new latent variable Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) to study faculty hiring networks. The model uses hierarchy information only as an input to the ERGM, where the hierarchy is obtained by modification of the Minimum Violation Ranking (MVR) method recently suggested in the literature. In contrast to single indices of ranking that can only capture partial features of a complex network, we demonstrate how our latent variable ERGM model provides a clustering of departments that does not necessarily align with the hierarchy as given by the MVR rankings, permits to simplify the network for ease of interpretation, and allows us to reproduce its main characteristics including its otherwise difficult to model presence of directed self-edges, common in faculty hiring networks. Throughout the paper, we illustrate our methods with application to the Industrial/Systems/Operations Research (IEOR) faculty hiring network, not studied before. The IEOR network is contrasted with those previously studied for other related disciplines, such as Computer Science and Business.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Castillo","given":"Enrique","non-dropping-particle":"del"},{"family":"Meyers","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Peng"}],"citation-key":"delcastilloExponentialRandomGraph2020","container-title":"IISE Transactions","DOI":"10.1080/24725854.2018.1557354","ISSN":"2472-5854","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,2]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/24725854.2018.1557354","page":"43-60","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Exponential random graph modeling of a faculty hiring network: The IEOR case","title-short":"Exponential random graph modeling of a faculty hiring network","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/24725854.2018.1557354","volume":"52"},

  {"id":"demirguc-kuntFinancialStructureEconomic2004","abstract":"This is the first broad cross-country assessment of the ties between financial structure -- the mix of financial instruments, institutions, and markets in a given economy -- and economic growth since Raymond Goldsmith's 1969 landmark study. Most studies focus on developed countries and compare bank-based and market-based systems. Debates over the relative merits of the two systems have relied on case studies of Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, countries with similar long-run growth rates. The absence of data on developing countries limits the usefulness of such studies for policy makers. The book contains recently acquired cross-country data from almost 150 countries. It includes information on the size, efficiency, and activity of banks, insurance companies, pension and mutual funds, finance companies, and stock and bond markets. It also incorporates information on each country's political, economic, and social environment. The chapters contain a mix of case studies, cross-country studies, macro- and micro-oriented approaches, and analytical and empirical work. The conclusions point not to markets versus banks, but to markets and banks. It is how well a financial system functions that is critical for long-run economic growth. The research suggests that strong legal rights for outside investors and the overall efficiency of contract enforcement are effective tools for developing the financial sector and the economy. The book includes a CD containing World Bank data.","author":[{"family":"Demirgüç-Kunt","given":"Asli"},{"family":"Levine","given":"Ross"}],"citation-key":"demirguc-kuntFinancialStructureEconomic2004","event-place":"Cambridge, MA","ISBN":"978-0-262-54179-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"452","publisher":"MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, MA","source":"Google Books","title":"Financial Structure and Economic Growth: A Cross-country Comparison of Banks, Markets, and Development","title-short":"Financial Structure and Economic Growth","type":"book"},

Yet, as we show, such decisions have profound effects on the results of real models for real data. We argue that substantive theory is typically too vague to be of use for feature selection, and that the supervised literature is not necessarily a helpful source of advice. To aid researchers working in unsupervised settings, we introduce a statistical procedure and software that examines the sensitivity of findings under alternate preprocessing regimes. This approach complements a researcher’s substantive understanding of a problem by providing a characterization of the variability changes in preprocessing choices may induce when analyzing a particular dataset. In making scholars aware of the degree to which their results are likely to be sensitive to their preprocessing decisions, it aids replication efforts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Denny","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Spirling","given":"Arthur"}],"citation-key":"dennyTextPreprocessingUnsupervised2018","container-title":"Political Analysis","DOI":"10.1017/pan.2017.44","ISSN":"1047-1987, 1476-4989","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4]]},"language":"en","page":"168-189","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Text Preprocessing For Unsupervised Learning: Why It Matters, When It Misleads, And What To Do About It","title-short":"Text Preprocessing For Unsupervised Learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/text-preprocessing-for-unsupervised-learning-why-it-matters-when-it-misleads-and-what-to-do-about-it/AA7D4DE0AA6AB208502515AE3EC6989E","volume":"26"},

Event history models can be used to analyze the dynamics of time-stamped network data. This paper adapts the discrete-time event history model to social network data. A discrete-time event history model can easily incorporate a multilevel design and time-varying covariates. A multilevel design is needed to account for dependencies among ties and vertices, which should not be ignored in a small longitudinal network. Time-varying covariates are required to analyze network effects, that is, the impact of previous ties. In addition, a discrete-time event history model handles constraints on who can act or who can be acted upon in a straightforward way. The model can be estimated with multilevel logistic regression analysis, which is illustrated by an application to book reviews, so network evolution can be analyzed with a fairly standard statistical tool.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Nooy","given":"Wouter","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"denooyNetworksActionEvents2011","container-title":"Social Networks","container-title-short":"Social Networks","DOI":"10.1016/j.socnet.2010.09.003","ISSN":"0378-8733","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,1]]},"page":"31-40","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Networks of action and events over time.

  {"id":"deutschmannLimitsFinancialization2011","abstract":"In the discussion on the causes of the financial crisis three main lines of argument can be distinguished: The „regulatory failure“ argument, the theory of the cyclical instability of financial markets, and analyses of „financialization“. From a sociological point of view, the latter analyses deserve particular interest, as they consider the crisis in the context of the larger structural changes of mature capitalist societies that have developed since the last decades of the 20th century. The paper first provides an overview of the financialization literature, focussing of the interplay between the changes on the macro-, meso- and micro levels of society that led to the present dominance of the financial services sector over the economy. Moreover, the historical analyses of Arrighi and Silver are considered. The second part of the paper offers a theoretical reconceptualization of the empirical findings in the framework of a multilevel model of capitalist dynamics. The model shows how a prosperous capitalist economy like the Western one in the second half of the 20th century can be transformed into a financialized economy due to its own internal dynamics. From a sociological perspective, financialization can thus be understood as a hegemonial regime of financial investors over entrepreneurs.","author":[{"family":"Deutschmann","given":"Christoph"}],"citation-key":"deutschmannLimitsFinancialization2011","container-title":"European Journal of Sociology / Archives Européennes de Sociologie","DOI":"10.1017/S0003975611000154","issue":"03","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"347-389","source":"Cambridge Journals Online","title":"Limits to Financialization","type":"article-journal","volume":"52"},

Yet little is known about the mobility patterns of scientists at an institutional level and how these career choices affect scientific outcomes. Here, we examine over 420,000 papers, to track the affiliation information of individual scientists, allowing us to reconstruct their career trajectories over decades. We find that career movements are not only temporally and spatially localized, but also characterized by a high degree of stratification in institutional ranking. When cross-group movement occurs, we find that while going from elite to lower-rank institutions on average associates with modest decrease in scientific performance, transitioning into elite institutions does not result in subsequent performance gain. These results offer empirical evidence on institutional level career choices and movements and have potential implications for science policy.","author":[{"family":"Deville","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Dashun"},{"family":"Sinatra","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Song","given":"Chaoming"},{"family":"Blondel","given":"Vincent D."},{"family":"Barabási","given":"Albert-László"}],"citation-key":"devilleCareerMoveGeography2014","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/srep04770","ISSN":"2045-2322","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,24]]},"language":"eng","page":"4770","PMCID":"PMC3998072","PMID":"24759743","source":"PubMed","title":"Career on the move: geography, stratification, and scientific impact","title-short":"Career on the move","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"diekmannReputationFormationEvolution2014","abstract":"Theoretical propositions stressing the importance of trust, reciprocity, and reputation for cooperation in social exchange relations are deeply rooted in classical sociological thought. Today’s online markets provide a unique opportunity to test these theories using unobtrusive data. Our study investigates the mechanisms promoting cooperation in an online-auction market where most transactions can be conceived as one-time-only exchanges. We first give a systematic account of the theoretical arguments explaining the process of cooperative transactions. Then, using a large dataset comprising 14,627 mobile phone auctions and 339,517 DVD auctions, we test key hypotheses about the effects of traders’ reputations on auction outcomes and traders’ motives for leaving feedback. Our statistical analyses show that sellers with better reputations have higher sales and obtain higher prices. Furthermore, we observe a high rate of participation in the feedback system, which is largely consistent with strong reciprocity—a predisposition to unconditionally reward (or punish) one’s interaction partner’s cooperation (or defection)—and altruism—a predisposition to increase one’s own utility by elevating an interaction partner’s utility. Our study demonstrates how strong reciprocity and altruism can mitigate the free-rider problem in the feedback system to create reputational incentives for mutually beneficial online trade.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Diekmann","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Jann","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Przepiorka","given":"Wojtek"},{"family":"Wehrli","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"diekmannReputationFormationEvolution2014","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.1177/0003122413512316","ISSN":"0003-1224, 1939-8271","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"65-85","source":"asr.sagepub.com","title":"Reputation Formation and the Evolution of Cooperation in Anonymous Online Markets","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://asr.sagepub.com/content/79/1/65","volume":"79"},
  {"id":"diesnerCommunicationNetworksEnron2005","abstract":"The Enron email corpus is appealing to researchers because it represents a rich temporal record of internal communication within a large, real-world organization facing a severe and survival-threatening crisis. We describe how we enhanced the original corpus database and present findings from our investigation undertaken with a social network analytic perspective. We explore the dynamics of the structure and properties of the organizational communication network, as well as the characteristics and patterns of communicative behavior of the employees from different organizational levels. We found that during the crisis period, communication among employees became more diverse with respect to established contacts and formal roles. Also during the crisis period, previously disconnected employees began to engage in mutual communication, so that interpersonal communication was intensified and spread through the network, bypassing formal chains of communication. The findings of this study provide valuable insight into a real-world organizational crisis, which may be further used for validating or developing theories and dynamic models of organizational crises; thereby leading to a better understanding of the underlying causes of, and response to, organization failure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Diesner","given":"Jana"},{"family":"Frantz","given":"Terrill L."},{"family":"Carley","given":"Kathleen M."}],"citation-key":"diesnerCommunicationNetworksEnron2005","container-title":"Computational & Mathematical Organization Theory","container-title-short":"Comput Math Organiz Theor","DOI":"10.1007/s10588-005-5377-0","ISSN":"1381-298X, 1572-9346","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"201-228","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Communication Networks from the Enron Email Corpus “It's Always About the People.

  {"id":"diesnerTextsNetworksDetecting2013","abstract":"This thesis (Diesner in Technical Report CMU-ISR-12-101, 2012) addresses a series of methodological problems related to extracting information on socio-technical networks from natural language text data. Theories and models from the social sciences are leveraged and combined with computational approaches to (a) construct, analyze and compare network data and (b) combine text data and network data for analysis. This thesis entails various projects that serve three purposes: First, the impact of various common coding choices, including reference resolution and co-occurrence-based link formation, on network data and analysis results is empirically identified across multiple types of text data and domains. Second, different relation extraction methods are compared across various over-time, open-source, large-scale datasets with respect to the resulting network data and analysis results. This study offers a complement to traditional strategies for accuracy assessment. The relation extraction methods considered include network data construction based on (a) manually versus automatically built thesauri, (b) meta-data, and (c) collaboration with subject matter experts. Third, the concepts of grouping and roles from network analysis are integrated with text mining methods to enable the theoretically grounded, joint consideration of text data and network data for real-world applications. Overall, in this thesis, an interdisciplinary and computationally rigorous approach is used; thereby advancing the intersection of network analysis, natural language processing and computing. The contributions made with this work help people to utilize text data for network analysis, and to collect, manage and interpret rich network data at any scale. These steps are preconditions for asking substantive and graph-theoretic questions, testing hypotheses, and advancing theories about networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,8,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Diesner","given":"Jana"}],"citation-key":"diesnerTextsNetworksDetecting2013","container-title":"KI - Künstliche Intelligenz","container-title-short":"Künstl Intell","DOI":"10.1007/s13218-012-0225-0","ISSN":"0933-1875, 1610-1987","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"75-78","source":"link.springer.com","title":"From Texts to Networks: Detecting and Managing the Impact of Methodological Choices for Extracting Network Data from Text Data","title-short":"From Texts to Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13218-012-0225-0","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"donoho50YearsData2017","abstract":"More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In “The Future of Data Analysis,” he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or “data analysis.” Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name “data science” for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of “data science” programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a $100M “Data Science Initiative” that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as “cultural appropriation.” This article reviews some ingredients of the current “data science moment,” including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for “scaling up” to “big data.” This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere “scaling up,” but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are “learning from data,” and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today’s data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals.

  {"id":"doreianSocialContextSpatial2012","abstract":"Frequently, social networks are studied in their own right with analyses devoid of contextual details. Yet contextual features – both social and spatial – can have impacts on the networks formed within them. This idea is explored with five empirical networks representing different contexts and the use of distinct modeling strategies. These strategies include network visualizations, QAP regression, exponential random graph models, blockmodeling and a combination of blockmodels with exponential random graph models within a single framework. We start with two empirical examples of networks inside organizations. The familiar Bank Wiring Room data show that the social organization (social context) and spatial arrangement of the room help account for the social relations formed there. The second example comes from a police academy where two designed arrangements, one social and one spatial, powerfully determine the relational social structures formed by recruits. The next example is an inter-organizational network that emerged as part of a response to a natural disaster where features of the improvised context helped account for the relations that formed between organizations participating in the search and rescue mission. We then consider an anthropological example of signed relations among sub-tribes in the New Guinea highlands where the physical geography is fixed. This is followed by a trading network off the Dalmatian coast where geography and physical conditions matter. Through these examples, we show that context matters by shaping the structure of networks that form and that a variety of network analytic tools can be mobilized to reveal how networks are shaped, in part, by social and spatial contexts. Implications for studying social networks are suggested.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Doreian","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Conti","given":"Norman"}],"citation-key":"doreianSocialContextSpatial2012","collection-title":"Capturing Context: Integrating Spatial and Social Network Analyses","container-title":"Social Networks","container-title-short":"Social Networks","DOI":"10.1016/j.socnet.2010.09.002","ISSN":"0378-8733","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"32-46","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Social context, spatial structure and social network structure","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037887331000047X","volume":"34"},

We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider the age composition of local and national contexts as well as intergenerational interactions.

  {"id":"drouhotReconsideringCommunityLiberated2017","abstract":"The “community liberated” thesis has been influential in describing contemporary social support systems. Specifically, “community liberated” argues that people do not seek support in their immediate neighborhood but rather entertain a network of far-flung ties to support-providing alters. This paper uses personal network data from six countries – Australia, Germany, the US, Austria, Hungary and Italy – to evaluate this argument and shows that the degree of liberation of one's community is strongly linked to one's socioeconomic status – specifically, one's education level. Additionally, we describe strong country-level heterogeneity in the spatial dynamics of personal support networks and find national contexts to be moderating the effect of education on community liberation, especially in Italy and Hungary, thus suggesting network geographic dispersion to be linked to national economic structures and labor markets. The paper thus elucidates the effect of two different, yet related social contexts on personal networks: the class context and the national context.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Drouhot","given":"Lucas G."}],"citation-key":"drouhotReconsideringCommunityLiberated2017","container-title":"Social Networks","container-title-short":"Social Networks","DOI":"10.1016/j.socnet.2016.07.005","ISSN":"0378-8733","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"57-77","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Reconsidering “community liberated”: How class and the national context shape personal support networks","title-short":"Reconsidering “community liberated”","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873316300259","volume":"48"},

This concerns the specifics of old age activation as well as the power-related implications and the normalizing and standardizing consequences of this re-negotiation of old age.

The second wave employed ethnographic methods to explore the local categories and configurations that inhabit, or constitute, these broader categories. In both waves, variation was seen as marking social categories. This article sets out a theoretical foundation for the third wave, arguing that (a) variation constitutes a robust social semiotic system, potentially expressing the full range of social concerns in a given community; (b) the meanings of variables are underspecified, gaining more specific meanings in the context of styles, and (c) variation does not simply reflect, but also constructs, social meaning and hence is a force in social change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Eckert","given":"Penelope"}],"citation-key":"eckertThreeWavesVariation2012","container-title":"Annual Review of Anthropology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-anthro-092611-145828","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-anthro-092611-145828","page":"87-100","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Three Waves of Variation Study: The Emergence of Meaning in the Study of Sociolinguistic Variation","title-short":"Three Waves of Variation Study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-anthro-092611-145828","volume":"41"},

The difficulty developing-country debtors have had in putting the current crisis behind them, it is argued, is due to the more systematic involvement of creditor-country governments and intergovernment agencies. This article reviews the negotiating strategies of the debtors and creditors of the 1930s, the terms of settlement, and the realized rates of return on U.S. and U.K. foreign bonds. It shows that rather than being sharp and complete, default in the 1930s was often partial and intermittent. Uncertainty about debt, trade, and export credits lingered on. Often many years passed before final settlements were achieved. Creditor-country governments were intimately involved in the settlement process, although their influence was not always to the benefit of the bondholders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,11,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Eichengreen","given":"Barry"},{"family":"Portes","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"eichengreenSettlingDefaultsEra1989","container-title":"The World Bank Economic Review","container-title-short":"The World Bank Economic Review","ISSN":"0258-6770","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1989,5,1]]},"note":"ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: May, 1989 / Copyright © 1989 Oxford University Press","page":"211-239","source":"JSTOR","title":"Settling Defaults in the Era of Bond Finance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3989893","volume":"3"},

This interpretation seeks to understand the role of FIFA as a business against the background of its football development programmes which have made the world soccer federation a most effective International Non-Governmental Organisation. Today, these football development programmes are shaping the way the leading persons in FIFA's Zurich headquarters are defining their policies. However, this development has had its price, because it has given rise to serious internal political conflicts within FIFA.

  {"id":"englandDesegregationStalledChanging2006","abstract":"Gender segregation in baccalaureate degree fields declined rapidly in the first half of the period from 1971 to 2002; at the same time, women's representation among baccalaureate degree recipients increased most rapidly relative to men's. The desegregation of the early period resulted mainly from women's increased entry into business-related fields and declining proportions of women majoring in traditional fields such as education and English. Men did not contribute to integration by moving toward fields numerically dominated by women. Fixed-effects regression models suggest that feminization of fields discourages later cohorts of men from entering them, as predicted by the devaluation perspective. The stalling of desegregation came from a combination of men's disinclination to enter fields that are \"too\" filled with women, and the slowdown in women making less traditional choices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,3]]},"author":[{"family":"England","given":"Paula"},{"family":"Li","given":"Su"}],"citation-key":"englandDesegregationStalledChanging2006","container-title":"Gender and Society","ISSN":"0891-2432","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"page":"657-677","publisher":"Sage Publications, Inc.","source":"JSTOR","title":"Desegregation Stalled: The Changing Gender Composition of College Majors, 1971-2002","title-short":"Desegregation Stalled","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/27640921","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"entwisleNetworksContextsVariation2007","abstract":"A core axiom of sociology is that social structure affects and is affected by human behavior. The term “social structure” conveys two quite different meanings. One meaning is relational, involving networks of ties between individuals or groups of individuals. A second meaning refers to the contexts containing these individuals. Studies of neighborhood and community effects depend on variability in both types of social structure. Using data from multiple villages in Nang Rong, Thailand, this article documents substantial variability in network structure and shows that network structure covaries with context in meaningful ways, suggesting reciprocal effects of changes in both. Finally, it considers implications of variability in network structure, showing that social cohesion affects the likelihood of finding and interviewing former village residents.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Entwisle","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Faust","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Rindfuss","given":"Ronald R."},{"family":"Kaneda","given":"Toshiko"}],"citation-key":"entwisleNetworksContextsVariation2007","container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","container-title-short":"American Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1086/511803","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,3,1]]},"page":"1495-1533","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Networks and Contexts: Variation in the Structure of Social Ties","title-short":"Networks and Contexts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/511803","volume":"112"},

Using UN databases, here we show that the international agro-food trade network (IFTN), with nodes and edges representing countries and import-export fluxes, respectively, has evolved into a highly heterogeneous, complex supply-chain network. Seven countries form the core of the IFTN, with high values of betweenness centrality and each trading with over 77% of all the countries in the world. Graph theoretical analysis and a dynamic food flux model show that the IFTN provides a vehicle suitable for the fast distribution of potential contaminants but unsuitable for tracing their origin. In particular, we show that high values of node betweenness and vulnerability correlate well with recorded large food poisoning outbreaks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ercsey-Ravasz","given":"Mária"},{"family":"Toroczkai","given":"Zoltán"},{"family":"Lakner","given":"Zoltán"},{"family":"Baranyi","given":"József"}],"citation-key":"ercsey-ravaszComplexityInternationalAgroFood2012","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0037810","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,5,31]]},"page":"e37810","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Complexity of the International Agro-Food Trade Network and Its Impact on Food Safety","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0037810","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"erhardDiverseEffectsMass2021","abstract":"Media discourse is often seen as an important condition of people’s attitudes and perceptions. Despite a rich literature, however, it is not well understood how media exposure influences attitudes towards immigrants. In contrast to previous studies, we argue that people rely on ‘availability heuristics’ shaped by mass media. From that point of view, it is the specific content of media discourse on immigration that affects people’s concerns. We use structural topic models to classify media content of more than 24,000 articles of leading German newspapers from 2001 to 2016. Utilizing linear fixed-effects models allows us to relate a person’s concern towards immigration, as reported in the German Socioeconomic Panel, to prevalent topics discussed in print media while controlling for several confounding factors (e.g., party preferences, interest in politics, etc.). We find a robust relationship between topic salience and attitudes towards integration. Our results reveal that specific topics with negative contents (e.g., domestic violence) increase concerns, while others (e.g., scientific studies, soccer) decrease concerns substantially, underlining the importance of available information provided by media. In addition, people with higher education are generally less affected by media salience of topics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Erhard","given":"Lukas"},{"family":"Heiberger","given":"Raphael H"},{"family":"Windzio","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"erhardDiverseEffectsMass2021","container-title":"European Sociological Review","container-title-short":"European Sociological Review","DOI":"10.1093/esr/jcab063","ISSN":"0266-7215","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,18]]},"page":"jcab063","source":"Silverchair","title":"Diverse Effects of Mass Media on Concerns about Immigration: New Evidence from Germany, 2001–2016","title-short":"Diverse Effects of Mass Media on Concerns about Immigration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcab063"},
  {"id":"erhartExperimentalDemonstrationUniversally2012","abstract":"The uncertainty principle generally prohibits simultaneous measurements of certain pairs of observables and forms the basis of indeterminacy in quantum mechanics. Heisenberg’s original formulation, illustrated by the famous γ-ray microscope, sets a lower bound for the product of the measurement error and the disturbance. Later, the uncertainty relation was reformulated in terms of standard deviations, where the focus was exclusively on the indeterminacy of predictions, whereas the unavoidable recoil in measuring devices has been ignored. A correct formulation of the error–disturbance uncertainty relation, taking recoil into account, is essential for a deeper understanding of the uncertainty principle, as Heisenberg’s original relation is valid only under specific circumstances. A new error–disturbance relation, derived using the theory of general quantum measurements, has been claimed to be universally valid. Here, we report a neutron-optical experiment that records the error of a spin-component measurement as well as the disturbance caused on another spin-component. The results confirm that both error and disturbance obey the new relation but violate the old one in a wide range of an experimental parameter.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Erhart","given":"Jacqueline"},{"family":"Sponar","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Sulyok","given":"Georg"},{"family":"Badurek","given":"Gerald"},{"family":"Ozawa","given":"Masanao"},{"family":"Hasegawa","given":"Yuji"}],"citation-key":"erhartExperimentalDemonstrationUniversally2012","container-title":"Nature Physics","container-title-short":"Nat Phys","DOI":"10.1038/nphys2194","ISSN":"1745-2473","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,3]]},"language":"en","page":"185-189","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Experimental demonstration of a universally valid error-disturbance uncertainty relation in spin measurements","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v8/n3/full/nphys2194.html","volume":"8"},

We use a graph-coloring game, in which nodes are given incentives to find a color that does not match their nearest neighbors, to represent the interdependent coordination problems inherent to the division of labor. We find that a decentralized development of a division of labor is difficult, particularly when too many specializations are chosen.

  {"id":"estevedelvallePoliticalInteractionParty2021","abstract":"A growing body of research has examined the uptake of social media by politicians, the formation of communication ties in online political networks, and the interplay between social media and political polarization. However, few studies have analyzed how social media are affecting communication in parliamentary networks. This is especially relevant in highly fragmented political systems in which collaboration between political parties is crucial to win support in parliament. Does MPs’ use of social media foster communications among parliamentarians who think differently, or does it result in like-minded clusters polarized along party lines, confining MPs to those who think alike? This study analyzes the formation of communication ties and the degree of homophily in the Dutch MPs’ @mention Twitter network. We employed exponential random graph models on a 1-year sample of all tweets in which Dutch MPs mentioned each other (N = 7,356) to discover the network parameters (reciprocity, popularity, and brokerage) and individual attributes (seniority, participation in the parliamentary commissions, age, gender, and geographical area) that facilitate communication ties among parliamentarians. Also, we measured party polarization by calculating the external–internal index of the mentions. Dutch MPs’ communication ties arise from network dynamics (reciprocity, brokerage, and popularity) and from MPs’ participation in the parliamentary commissions, age, gender, and geographical area. Furthermore, there is a high degree of cross-party interactions in the Dutch MPs’ mentions Twitter network. Our results refute the existence of “echo chambers” in the Dutch MPs’ mentions Twitter network and support the hypothesis that social media can open up spaces for discussion among political parties. This is particularly important in fragmented consensus democracies where negotiation and coordination between parties to form coalitions is key.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Esteve Del Valle","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Broersma","given":"Marcel"},{"family":"Ponsioen","given":"Arnout"}],"citation-key":"estevedelvallePoliticalInteractionParty2021","container-title":"Social Science Computer Review","container-title-short":"Social Science Computer Review","DOI":"10.1177/0894439320987569","ISSN":"0894-4393","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,2]]},"language":"en","page":"0894439320987569","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Political Interaction Beyond Party Lines: Communication Ties and Party Polarization in Parliamentary Twitter Networks","title-short":"Political Interaction Beyond Party Lines","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439320987569"},

We examine the effects of doubtful language on comment popularity (i.e., recommendations from other users) and the use of emotional language in subsequent replies. We examine data from 1.9 million user comments from the New York Times website. Comments containing doubtful language were less popular, receiving fewer user recommendations. Additionally, replies to doubtful comments were less emotional (containing fewer positive emotions and fewer negative emotions).

These opinions are expressed in written language, and this paper presents a method for modeling the aspects of overall customer satisfaction from free-form written opinions. Written opinions constitute unstructured input data, which are first transformed into semi-structured data using an existing method for aspect-level sentiment analysis. Next, the overall customer satisfaction is modeled using a Bayesian approach based on the individual aspect rating of each review.

  {"id":"farrellCorporateFundingIdeological2016","abstract":"Drawing on large-scale computational data and methods, this research demonstrates how polarization efforts are influenced by a patterned network of political and financial actors. These dynamics, which have been notoriously difficult to quantify, are illustrated here with a computational analysis of climate change politics in the United States. The comprehensive data incinlude all individual and organizational actors in the climate change countermovement (164 organizations), as well as all written and verbal texts produced by this network between 1993–2013 (40,785 texts, more than 39 million words). Two main findings emerge. First, that organizations with corporate funding were more likely to have written and disseminated texts meant to polarize the climate change issue. Second, and more importantly, that corporate funding influences the actual thematic content of these polarization efforts, and the discursive prevalence of that thematic content over time. These findings provide new, and comprehensive, confirmation of dynamics long thought to be at the root of climate change politics and discourse. Beyond the specifics of climate change, this paper has important implications for understanding ideological polarization more generally, and the increasing role of private funding in determining why certain polarizing themes are created and amplified. Lastly, the paper suggests that future studies build on the novel approach taken here that integrates large-scale textual analysis with social networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Farrell","given":"Justin"}],"citation-key":"farrellCorporateFundingIdeological2016","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1509433112","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"92-97","PMID":"26598653","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Corporate funding and ideological polarization about climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/113/1/92","volume":"113"},
  {"id":"fasangSocialClosureEducational2014","abstract":"This article examines how network closure among parents affects adolescents’ educational attainment. First, we introduce a distinction between informal closure and school-based closure. Second, we investigate whether and how the effect of informal and school-based parental network closure varies across social contexts. Findings from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) and multilevel models show that parental network closure modestly impacts educational outcomes. Moreover, educational benefits of informal closure in parent networks are contingent on social context. Closure only benefits educational attainment in low-poverty schools. In high-poverty schools, informal closure in parent networks lowers educational attainment. The social closure generated in informal connections among parents thereby contributes to the encapsulation of disadvantage in areas of concentrated poverty, which is not the case for school-based closure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Fasang","given":"Anette Eva"},{"family":"Mangino","given":"William"},{"family":"Brückner","given":"Hannah"}],"citation-key":"fasangSocialClosureEducational2014","container-title":"Sociological Forum","DOI":"10.1111/socf.12073","ISSN":"1573-7861","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/socf.12073","page":"137-164","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Social Closure and Educational Attainment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/socf.12073","volume":"29"},

With deregulation, the number and volume of originated mortgage loans increase, while denial rates fall. But the deregulation has no effect on a placebo sample, formed of independent mortgage companies that should not be affected by the regulatory change. This sharpens the causal interpretation of our results. Deregulation boosts the supply of mortgage credit, which has significant end effects on house prices. We find evidence house prices rise with branching deregulation, particularly so in Metropolitan Areas where construction is inelastic for topographic reasons. There is also evidence the fall in house prices after 2006 is most pronounced in least regulated states. We document these results in a large sample of counties across the U.S. We also focus on a reduced cross-section formed by counties on each side of a state border, where a regression discontinuity approach is possible.

  {"id":"fehrAltruisticPunishmentHumans2002","abstract":"Human cooperation is an evolutionary puzzle. Unlike other creatures, people frequently cooperate with genetically unrelated strangers, often in large groups, with people they will never meet again, and when reputation gains are small or absent. These patterns of cooperation cannot be explained by the nepotistic motives associated with the evolutionary theory of kin selection and the selfish motives associated with signalling theory or the theory of reciprocal altruism. Here we show experimentally that the altruistic punishment of defectors is a key motive for the explanation of cooperation. Altruistic punishment means that individuals punish, although the punishment is costly for them and yields no material gain. We show that cooperation flourishes if altruistic punishment is possible, and breaks down if it is ruled out. The evidence indicates that negative emotions towards defectors are the proximate mechanism behind altruistic punishment. These results suggest that future study of the evolution of human cooperation should include a strong focus on explaining altruistic punishment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Fehr","given":"Ernst"},{"family":"Gächter","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"fehrAltruisticPunishmentHumans2002","container-title":"Nature","container-title-short":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/415137a","ISSN":"0028-0836","issue":"6868","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,1,10]]},"language":"en","page":"137-140","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Altruistic punishment in humans","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v415/n6868/abs/415137a.html","volume":"415"},

Findings show that adolescent popularity and centrality tend to reach their maximum in early adolescence and then consistently decline until 12th grade. Results also demonstrate that both school transitions propel the process of declining centrality, by exacerbating the negative consequences to individual centrality. Furthermore, students who transition between 8th and 9th grade experience declines in social integration that persist until the end of high school. Thus, during the period of adolescence, people become less popular and are known by fewer people over time, and school transitions magnify these potentially problematic trends.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Felmlee","given":"Diane H."},{"family":"McMillan","given":"Cassie"},{"family":"Inara Rodis","given":"Paulina"},{"family":"Osgood","given":"D.

  {"id":"fergusonSpecializationCareerDynamics2013","abstract":"In this article, we attempt to resolve the tension between two conflicting views on the role of specialization in workers’ careers. Some scholars argue that specialization is a net benefit that allows workers to get ahead, while others argue that broad experience across several domains is the only way to be truly exceptional. We use rich longitudinal data from 1974 to 2008 on the careers of Indian Administrative Service officers, members of the Republic of India’s elite bureaucratic service, to test both these hypotheses. We find that specialization benefits officers throughout their career. We distinguish between skill-based and signal-based mechanisms that relate specialization to promotion, by exploring the match (or lack thereof) between the skills officers acquire and the jobs to which they are promoted, and we find that both mechanisms operate, but at different points in the career. Specialization is rewarded later in officers’ careers because of the skills they acquire by specializing. Earlier in their careers, skills are less important; it appears that specialization benefits officers because it is a signal of general ability. These results contradict studies that find that specialization helps early in careers but fades with experience, but they also call into question the idea that specialization always reflects accumulated skill. Our results support both types of theories but suggest important scope conditions for when one mechanism or the other is likely to dominate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Ferguson","given":"John-Paul"},{"family":"Hasan","given":"Sharique"}],"citation-key":"fergusonSpecializationCareerDynamics2013","container-title":"Administrative Science Quarterly","container-title-short":"Administrative Science Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/0001839213486759","ISSN":"0001-8392","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"233-256","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Specialization and Career Dynamics: Evidence from the Indian Administrative Service","title-short":"Specialization and Career Dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0001839213486759","volume":"58"},
  {"id":"fergusonStrategiesMitigatingInfluenza2006","abstract":"Development of strategies for mitigating the severity of a new influenza pandemic is now a top global public health priority. Influenza prevention and containment strategies can be considered under the broad categories of antiviral, vaccine and non-pharmaceutical (case isolation, household quarantine, school or workplace closure, restrictions on travel) measures. Mathematical models are powerful tools for exploring this complex landscape of intervention strategies and quantifying the potential costs and benefits of different options. Here we use a large-scale epidemic simulation to examine intervention options should initial containment of a novel influenza outbreak fail, using Great Britain and the United States as examples. We find that border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay spread by more than 2-3 weeks unless more than 99% effective. School closure during the peak of a pandemic can reduce peak attack rates by up to 40%, but has little impact on overall attack rates, whereas case isolation or household quarantine could have a significant impact, if feasible. Treatment of clinical cases can reduce transmission, but only if antivirals are given within a day of symptoms starting. Given enough drugs for 50% of the population, household-based prophylaxis coupled with reactive school closure could reduce clinical attack rates by 40-50%. More widespread prophylaxis would be even more logistically challenging but might reduce attack rates by over 75%. Vaccine stockpiled in advance of a pandemic could significantly reduce attack rates even if of low efficacy. Estimates of policy effectiveness will change if the characteristics of a future pandemic strain differ substantially from those seen in past pandemics.","author":[{"family":"Ferguson","given":"Neil M."},{"family":"Cummings","given":"Derek A.

Considering that the total enterprise only came into being in the early 70s (taking The SSRC's Summer Institute on Sociolinguistics at Indiana University, 1964, as a reasonable date of departure) some progress toward meeting this challenge is undeniable. Such progress is particularly great at the micro-level where variation theory, discourse analysis, speech act theory, pragmatics, and ethnomethodological concerns and sensitivities have pretty much become modern day orthodoxies that often neither recognize nor remember their sociolinguistic co-origins. Nevertheless, precisely here, where the links to linguistics are strongest, there is hardly any link to sociology or to sociocultural theory more generally (none at all, indeed, except for the ethnomethodological corner thereof). If we look for linkages between macro-sociolinguistic efforts and the parent disciplines, the situation is even less heartening, because not only are such links exceedingly few and far between, but nothing approaching schools of thought or elaborated points of view are discernible.

We test the hypothesis that brokerage—direct ties to collaborators who themselves do not have direct ties to each other—leads to greater collaborative creativity. We then test interaction hypotheses on the marginal benefits of cohesion, when collaborators have independent ties between themselves that do not include the individual. We identify the moderators of brokerage and argue for contingent benefits, based on the interaction of structure with the attributes, career experiences, and extended networks of individuals and their collaborators. Using a social definition of creative success, we also trace the development of creative ideas from their generation through future use by others. We test the hypothesis that brokered ideas are less likely to be used in future creative efforts. The results illustrate how collaborative brokerage can aid in the generation of an idea but then hamper its diffusion and use by others.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Fleming","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Mingo","given":"Santiago"},{"family":"Chen","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"flemingCollaborativeBrokerageGenerative2007","container-title":"Administrative Science Quarterly","container-title-short":"Administrative Science Quarterly","DOI":"10.2189/asqu.52.3.443","ISSN":"0001-8392","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"443-475","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Collaborative Brokerage, Generative Creativity, and Creative Success","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.2189/asqu.52.3.443","volume":"52"},

We suggest that these households are feeling the effects of growing inequality at the top more acutely and they respond by changing how they think about their financial lives.

We use theory from the literature on culture, cognition, and framing to explain this puzzle. Consistent with recent work on “positive asymmetry,” we show how the FOMC generally interpreted discomforting facts in a positive light, marginalizing and normalizing anomalous information. We argue that all frames limit what can be understood, but the content of frames matters for how facts are identified and explained. We provide evidence that the Federal Reserve’s primary frame for making sense of the economy was macroeconomic theory. The content of macroeconomics made it difficult for the FOMC to connect events into a narrative reflecting the links between foreclosures in the housing market, the financial instruments used to package the mortgages into securities, and the threats to the larger economy.

There is a great deal of agreement that markets are social structures characterized by extensive social relationships between firms, workers, suppliers, customers, and governments. But, like in many sociological literatures, the theory camps that have formed often seem to speak by each other. We show that some of the disagreement between theory camps is due to differences in conceptual language, and other disagreements stem from the fact that theory camps ignore the concepts in other theory camps, thereby making their theories less complete. We end by considering deeper controversies in the literature that seem open both to new conceptualization and further empirical research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Fligstein","given":"Neil"},{"family":"Dauter","given":"Luke"}],"citation-key":"fligsteinSociologyMarkets2007","container-title":"Annual Review of Sociology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131736","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"page":"105-128","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"The Sociology of Markets","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131736","volume":"33"},
  {"id":"fligsteinSuckerPunchedInvisible2014","abstract":"The worldwide financial crisis that began in 2007 was set off by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market in the USA. The crisis simultaneously reverberated to banks around the world, and eventually brought about a worldwide recession. The biggest banks in the developed world got in trouble because they were pursuing the same strategies to make profit as the American banks. They had joined the market in the USA for mortgage-backed securities and funded them by borrowing in the asset-backed commercial paper market. When the housing market turned down, they suffered the same fate as their US counterparts. Financial deregulation played a complex role in this process. Most of the banks that participated in this market came from countries where financial deregulation occurred. But not all banks from countries with financial deregulation entered this market. Countries with high levels of financial deregulation also experienced deeper recessions, suggesting that in the home market, banks had taken on riskier loans as well. Our study makes a broader theoretical point, suggesting that subsequent studies of global finance and financial markets need to consider the identities and strategies of the banks as their tactics explain a lot about how the global markets for different financial products are structured.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Fligstein","given":"Neil"},{"family":"Habinek","given":"Jacob"}],"citation-key":"fligsteinSuckerPunchedInvisible2014","container-title":"Socio-Economic Review","container-title-short":"Socioecon Rev","DOI":"10.1093/ser/mwu004","ISSN":"1475-1461, 1475-147X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,10]]},"language":"en","page":"637-665","source":"ser.oxfordjournals.org","title":"Sucker punched by the invisible hand: the world financial markets and the globalization of the US mortgage crisis","title-short":"Sucker punched by the invisible hand","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ser.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/4/637","volume":"12"},

One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs.

A popular method now widely used relies on the optimization of a quantity called modularity, which is a quality index for a partition of a network into communities. We find that modularity optimization may fail to identify modules smaller than a scale which depends on the total size of the network and on the degree of interconnectedness of the modules, even in cases where modules are unambiguously defined. This finding is confirmed through several examples, both in artificial and in real social, biological, and technological networks, where we show that modularity optimization indeed does not resolve a large number of modules. A check of the modules obtained through modularity optimization is thus necessary, and we provide here key elements for the assessment of the reliability of this community detection method.\ncomplex networks modular structure metabolic networks social networks","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Fortunato","given":"Santo"},{"family":"Barthélemy","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"fortunatoResolutionLimitCommunity2007","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"fortunatoScienceScience2018","abstract":"The whys and wherefores of SciSci\nThe science of science (SciSci) is based on a transdisciplinary approach that uses large data sets to study the mechanisms underlying the doing of science—from the choice of a research problem to career trajectories and progress within a field. In a Review, Fortunato et al. explain that the underlying rationale is that with a deeper understanding of the precursors of impactful science, it will be possible to develop systems and policies that improve each scientist's ability to succeed and enhance the prospects of science as a whole.\nScience, this issue p. eaao0185\nStructured Abstract\nBACKGROUNDThe increasing availability of digital data on scholarly inputs and outputs—from research funding, productivity, and collaboration to paper citations and scientist mobility—offers unprecedented opportunities to explore the structure and evolution of science. The science of science (SciSci) offers a quantitative understanding of the interactions among scientific agents across diverse geographic and temporal scales: It provides insights into the conditions underlying creativity and the genesis of scientific discovery, with the ultimate goal of developing tools and policies that have the potential to accelerate science. In the past decade, SciSci has benefited from an influx of natural, computational, and social scientists who together have developed big data–based capabilities for empirical analysis and generative modeling that capture the unfolding of science, its institutions, and its workforce. The value proposition of SciSci is that with a deeper understanding of the factors that drive successful science, we can more effectively address environmental, societal, and technological problems.\nADVANCESScience can be described as a complex, self-organizing, and evolving network of scholars, projects, papers, and ideas. This representation has unveiled patterns characterizing the emergence of new scientific fields through the study of collaboration networks and the path of impactful discoveries through the study of citation networks. Microscopic models have traced the dynamics of citation accumulation, allowing us to predict the future impact of individual papers. SciSci has revealed choices and trade-offs that scientists face as they advance both their own careers and the scientific horizon. For example, measurements indicate that scholars are risk-averse, preferring to study topics related to their current expertise, which constrains the potential of future discoveries. Those willing to break this pattern engage in riskier careers but become more likely to make major breakthroughs. Overall, the highest-impact science is grounded in conventional combinations of prior work but features unusual combinations. Last, as the locus of research is shifting into teams, SciSci is increasingly focused on the impact of team research, finding that small teams tend to disrupt science and technology with new ideas drawing on older and less prevalent ones. In contrast, large teams tend to develop recent, popular ideas, obtaining high, but often short-lived, impact.\nOUTLOOKSciSci offers a deep quantitative understanding of the relational structure between scientists, institutions, and ideas because it facilitates the identification of fundamental mechanisms responsible for scientific discovery. These interdisciplinary data-driven efforts complement contributions from related fields such as scientometrics and the economics and sociology of science. Although SciSci seeks long-standing universal laws and mechanisms that apply across various fields of science, a fundamental challenge going forward is accounting for undeniable differences in culture, habits, and preferences between different fields and countries. This variation makes some cross-domain insights difficult to appreciate and associated science policies difficult to implement. The differences among the questions, data, and skills specific to each discipline suggest that further insights can be gained from domain-specific SciSci studies, which model and identify opportunities adapted to the needs of individual research fields. <img class=\"fragment-image\" src=\"https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/359/6379/eaao0185/F1.medium.gif\"/> Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint The complexity of science.Science can be seen as an expanding and evolving network of ideas, scholars, and papers.

  {"id":"foschiPreferentialAttachmentMultiple2014","abstract":"In this paper we develop a model for the evolution of multiple networks which is able to replicate the concentrated and sparse nature of world trade data. Our model is an extension of the preferential attachment growth model to the case of multiple networks. Countries trade a variety of goods of different complexity. Every country progressively evolves from trading less sophisticated to high-tech goods. The probabilities of capturing more trade opportunities at a given level of complexity and of starting to trade more complex goods are both proportional to the number of existing trade links. We provide a set of theoretical predictions and simulative results. A calibration exercise shows that our model replicates the same concentration level of world trade as well as the sparsity pattern of the trade matrix. We also discuss a set of numerical solutions to deal with large multiple networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Foschi","given":"Rachele"},{"family":"Riccaboni","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Schiavo","given":"Stefano"}],"citation-key":"foschiPreferentialAttachmentMultiple2014","container-title":"Physical Review E","container-title-short":"Phys.

I offer a critical overview of the sociology of markets as it relates to our concepts of society, focusing on four main representations of what is sociologically important about markets: the social networks that sustain them, the systems of social positions that organize them, the institutionalization processes that stabilize them, and the performative techniques that bring them into existence. I then speculate about the possible future directions that such theorizing might take, calling in particular for a stronger contribution of the sociology of markets to the analysis of societies as moral orders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Fourcade","given":"Marion"}],"citation-key":"fourcadeTheoriesMarketsTheories2007","container-title":"American Behavioral Scientist","container-title-short":"American Behavioral Scientist","DOI":"10.1177/0002764207299351","ISSN":"0002-7642, 1552-3381","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,1,4]]},"language":"en","page":"1015-1034","source":"abs.sagepub.com","title":"Theories of Markets and Theories of Society","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://abs.sagepub.com/content/50/8/1015","volume":"50"},
  {"id":"foverskovSocioeconomicInequalityHealth2016","abstract":"Despite social inequality in health being well documented, it is still debated which causal mechanism best explains the negative association between socioeconomic position (SEP) and health. This paper is concerned with testing the explanatory power of three widely proposed causal explanations for social inequality in health in adulthood: the social causation hypothesis (SEP determines health), the health selection hypothesis (health determines SEP) and the indirect selection hypothesis (no causal relationship). We employ dynamic data of respondents aged 30 to 60 from the last nine waves of the British Household Panel Survey. Household income and location on the Cambridge Scale is included as measures of different dimensions of SEP and health is measured as a latent factor score. The causal hypotheses are tested using a time-based Granger approach by estimating dynamic fixed effects panel regression models following the method suggested by Anderson and Hsiao. We propose using this method to estimate the associations over time since it allows one to control for all unobserved time-invariant factors and hence lower the chances of biased estimates due to unobserved heterogeneity. The results showed no proof of the social causation hypothesis over a one to five year period and limited support for the health selection hypothesis was seen only for men in relation to HH income. These findings were robust in multiple sensitivity analysis. We conclude that the indirect selection hypothesis may be the most important in explaining social inequality in health in adulthood, indicating that the well-known cross-sectional correlations between health and SEP in adulthood seem not to be driven by a causal relationship, but instead by dynamics and influences in place before the respondents turn 30 years old that affect both their health and SEP onwards. The conclusion is limited in that we do not consider the effect of specific diseases and causal relationships in adulthood may be present over a longer timespan than 5 years.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Foverskov","given":"Else"},{"family":"Holm","given":"Anders"}],"citation-key":"foverskovSocioeconomicInequalityHealth2016","container-title":"Social Science & Medicine","container-title-short":"Social Science & Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.12.021","ISSN":"0277-9536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2]]},"page":"172-183","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Socioeconomic inequality in health in the British household panel: Tests of the social causation, health selection and the indirect selection hypothesis using dynamic fixed effects panel models","title-short":"Socioeconomic inequality in health in the British household panel","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953615302811","volume":"150"},

It can be regarded as an direct application of Bayesian inference to the problem of model selection, combined estimation and prediction. BMA produces a straightforward model choice criterion and less risky predictions. However, the application of BMA is not always straightforward, leading to diverse assumptions and situational choices on its different aspects. Despite the widespread application of BMA in the literature, there were not many accounts of these differences and trends besides a few landmark revisions in the late 1990s and early 2000s, therefore not accounting for advancements made in the last decades. In this work, we present an account of these developments through a careful content analysis of 820 articles in BMA published between 1996 and 2016. We also develop a conceptual classification scheme to better describe this vast literature, understand its trends and future directions and provide guidance for the researcher interested in both the application and development of the methodology.

Why do top athletes win dozens of sponsorship deals, yet competitors who finish just moments behind struggle to attract a single deal?

The answer is the rise of 'winner-take-all' markets, in which small differences in performance lead to huge differences in reward.  More relevant today than ever before, this fascinating book shows how in business, as in sport, thousands are competing for only a handful of top prizes. As Robert Frank and Philip J Cook reveal, this relentless emphasis on coming out on top has shaped our society and how we define success in troubling ways, creating growing income inequality and an enormous misallocation of talent, as more and more gifted people seek the big bucks and limelight of lucrative yet non-essential careers while vital professions scramble to attract staff.

It does so on the basis of interviews with editors of large publishing houses and regression analysis of a dataset that contains prices and their determinants of over 80 000 fiction books. We show that material properties such as the size, binding and number of pages of a book are the strongest predictors of price. This is surprising, because the actual paper and printing costs constitute only a small fraction of the sales price. Publishers, we argue, set prices as if material properties matter. The advantage of relying on these material properties is that publishers can manipulate them through their main pricing device, the profit and loss statement. Moreover, relying on materiality instead of quality when pricing goods allows publishers to create market order and to make their prices seem fair to consumers. In one respect, quality is factored into price as well: publishers use genre as a judgement device when setting prices. As a result, the dominant status hierarchy is reproduced through prices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Franssen","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Velthuis","given":"Olav"}],"citation-key":"franssenMakingMaterialityMatter2014","container-title":"Socio-Economic Review","container-title-short":"Socioecon Rev","DOI":"10.1093/ser/mwu025","ISSN":"1475-1461, 1475-147X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,8,8]]},"language":"en","page":"mwu025","source":"ser.oxfordjournals.org","title":"Making materiality matter: a sociological analysis of prices on the Dutch fiction book market, 1980–2009","title-short":"Making materiality matter","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ser.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/08/07/ser.mwu025"},

  {"id":"frenetteLeveragingYouthOvercoming2019","abstract":"The sociological literature on creativity would suggest that collaboration between newcomers and more experienced members of an art world results in the fruitful combination of novelty and usefulness, though not without some conflict. Drawing on fieldwork and interviews with workers from the popular recording industry (rock/pop) in New York City, this article extends the literature on creativity as collective action by showing how three types of intergenerational tensions (aesthetic, technological, and career) are embedded in the ways newcomers and experienced workers see themselves and each other as agents of change and stasis. I propose a new variable—leveraging age—a mechanism intergenerational collaborators use to resolve or override these tensions to ultimately maximize creativity in group contexts. Leveraging age, as a form of knowledge extraction, occurs in creative bureaucratic organizations and describes how newcomers and experienced workers dualistically draw on each other’s respective strengths (novelty and tradition). I primarily examine the bottom-up part of this process—how experienced workers draw on the insights of newcomers—by analyzing five leveraging-youth practices, which vary by level of formality and intentionality, but mostly limit the interactional challenges between the two groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Frenette","given":"Alexandre"}],"citation-key":"frenetteLeveragingYouthOvercoming2019","container-title":"Social Psychology Quarterly","container-title-short":"Soc Psychol Q","DOI":"10.1177/0190272519871297","ISSN":"0190-2725","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,26]]},"language":"en","page":"0190272519871297","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Leveraging Youth: Overcoming Intergenerational Tensions in Creative Production","title-short":"Leveraging Youth","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0190272519871297"},

  {"id":"frickelGeneralTheoryScientific2005","abstract":"[The histories of all modern scientific and intellectual fields are marked by dynamism. Yet, despite a welter of case study data, sociologists of ideas have been slow to develop general theories for explaining why and how disciplines, subfields, theory groups, bandwagons, actor networks, and other kindred formations arise to alter the intellectual landscape. To fill this lacuna, this article presents a general theory of scientific/intellectual movements (SIMs). The theory synthesizes work in the sociology of ideas, social studies of science, and the literature on social movements to explain the dynamics of SIMs, which the authors take to be central mechanisms for change in the world of knowledge and ideas. Illustrating their arguments with a diverse sampling of positive and negative cases, they define SIMs, identify a set of theoretical presuppositions, and offer four general propositions for explaining the social conditions under which SIMs are most likely to emerge, gain prestige, and achieve some level of institutional stability.]","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,4]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Frickel","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Gross","given":"Neil"}],"citation-key":"frickelGeneralTheoryScientific2005","container-title":"American Sociological Review","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"page":"204-232","source":"JSTOR","title":"A General Theory of Scientific/Intellectual Movements","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4145368","volume":"70"},

We articulate some of these key challenges, provide new perspectives on the study of gene–environment interactions, and end by offering some practical guidance for conducting research in this area. Given the sudden availability of well-powered polygenic scores, we anticipate a substantial increase in research testing for interaction between such scores and environments.

We address this question by drawing on 120 years of “recreations” data (N = 71,393) contained within Who’s Who, a unique catalogue of the British elite. Our results reveal three historical phases of elite cultural distinction: first, a mode of aristocratic practice forged around the leisure possibilities afforded by landed estates, which waned significantly in the late-nineteenth century; second, a highbrow mode dominated by the fine arts, which increased sharply in the early-twentieth century before gently receding in the most recent birth cohorts; and, third, a contemporary mode characterized by the blending of highbrow pursuits with everyday forms of cultural participation, such as spending time with family, friends, and pets. These shifts reveal changes not only in the contents of elite culture but also in the nature of elite distinction, in particular, (1) how the applicability of emulation and (mis)recognition theories has changed over time, and (2) the emergence of a contemporary mode that publicly emphasizes everyday cultural practice (to accentuate ordinariness, authenticity, and cultural connection) while retaining many tastes that continue to be (mis)recognized as legitimate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Friedman","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Reeves","given":"Aaron"}],"citation-key":"friedmanAristocraticOrdinaryShifting2020","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/0003122420912941","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"323-350","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"From Aristocratic to Ordinary: Shifting Modes of Elite Distinction","title-short":"From Aristocratic to Ordinary","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122420912941","volume":"85"},

For business consultants who sell financial metrics and implementation, shareholder value is also a product and a promise that purposive management action will be rewarded.

It then presents empirics on micro performance and the meso limits to shareholder value and argues that most corporate managements cannot easily deliver what consultants promise and the capital markets demand. The paper ends by taking a broader view of value-based management as part of a process of financialization.

  {"id":"gabaixTheoryPowerlawDistributions2003","abstract":"Insights into the dynamics of a complex system are often gained by focusing on large fluctuations. For the financial system, huge databases now exist that facilitate the analysis of large fluctuations and the characterization of their statistical behaviour. Power laws appear to describe histograms of relevant financial fluctuations, such as fluctuations in stock price, trading volume and the number of trades. Surprisingly, the exponents that characterize these power laws are similar for different types and sizes of markets, for different market trends and even for different countries—suggesting that a generic theoretical basis may underlie these phenomena. Here we propose a model, based on a plausible set of assumptions, which provides an explanation for these empirical power laws. Our model is based on the hypothesis that large movements in stock market activity arise from the trades of large participants. Starting from an empirical characterization of the size distribution of those large market participants (mutual funds), we show that the power laws observed in financial data arise when the trading behaviour is performed in an optimal way. Our model additionally explains certain striking empirical regularities that describe the relationship between large fluctuations in prices, trading volume and the number of trades.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Gabaix","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Gopikrishnan","given":"Parameswaran"},{"family":"Plerou","given":"Vasiliki"},{"family":"Stanley","given":"H.

It goes on to illustrate the criminological value of these ideas by means of an analysis of some of the governmental rationalities and technologies that are currently emerging in the field of crime control. These include `economic' forms of reasoning about crime and its control, the emergence of `the criminogenic situation' as a practicable object of government and the use of `technologies of the self' in penal settings. The final part of the article identifies some of the limitations and problems of the `governmentality' literature. It argues that studies of governmentality beg certain sociological questions; that the governmentality analytic is quite compatible with certain forms of sociological analysis; and that the project of writing a history of the present is best pursued — in the field of crime control at least — by combining these forms of enquiry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Garland","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"garlandGovernmentalityProblemCrime1997","container-title":"Theoretical Criminology","container-title-short":"Theoretical Criminology","DOI":"10.1177/1362480697001002002","ISSN":"1362-4806","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1997,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"173-214","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"`Governmentality' and the Problem of Crime:: Foucault, Criminology, Sociology","title-short":"`Governmentality' and the Problem of Crime","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1362480697001002002","volume":"1"},

Each (directed) link is weighted by the amount of wealth flowing between two countries, and each country is characterized by the value of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By analysing a set of year-by-year data covering the time interval 1950–2000, we show that the dynamics of all GDP values and the evolution of the WTW (trade flow and topology) are tightly coupled. The probability that two countries are connected depends on their GDP values, supporting recent theoretical models relating network topology to the presence of a `hidden' variable (or fitness).

  {"id":"garzarelliMemoryEffectsStock2014","abstract":"Technical trading represents a class of investment strategies for Financial Markets based on the analysis of trends and recurrent patterns in price time series. According standard economical theories these strategies should not be used because they cannot be profitable. On the contrary, it is well-known that technical traders exist and operate on different time scales. In this paper we investigate if technical trading produces detectable signals in price time series and if some kind of memory effects are introduced in the price dynamics. In particular, we focus on a specific figure called supports and resistances. We first develop a criterion to detect the potential values of supports and resistances. Then we show that memory effects in the price dynamics are associated to these selected values. In fact we show that prices more likely re-bounce than cross these values. Such an effect is a quantitative evidence of the so-called self-fulfilling prophecy, that is the self-reinforcement of agents' belief and sentiment about future stock prices' behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Garzarelli","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Cristelli","given":"Matthieu"},{"family":"Pompa","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Zaccaria","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Pietronero","given":"Luciano"}],"citation-key":"garzarelliMemoryEffectsStock2014","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/srep04487","ISSN":"2045-2322","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,3,27]]},"PMCID":"PMC3967202","PMID":"24671011","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Memory effects in stock price dynamics: evidences of technical trading","title-short":"Memory effects in stock price dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3967202/","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"gattoSpreadDynamicsCOVID192020","abstract":"<p>The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy prompted drastic measures for transmission containment. We examine the effects of these interventions, based on modeling of the unfolding epidemic. We test modeling options of the spatially explicit type, suggested by the wave of infections spreading from the initial foci to the rest of Italy. We estimate parameters of a metacommunity Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Recovered (SEIR)-like transmission model that includes a network of 107 provinces connected by mobility at high resolution, and the critical contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. We estimate a generalized reproduction number (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"i1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub></math> = 3.60 [3.49 to 3.84]), the spectral radius of a suitable next-generation matrix that measures the potential spread in the absence of containment interventions. The model includes the implementation of progressive restrictions after the first case confirmed in Italy (February 21, 2020) and runs until March 25, 2020. We account for uncertainty in epidemiological reporting, and time dependence of human mobility matrices and awareness-dependent exposure probabilities. We draw scenarios of different containment measures and their impact. Results suggest that the sequence of restrictions posed to mobility and human-to-human interactions have reduced transmission by 45% (42 to 49%). Averted hospitalizations are measured by running scenarios obtained by selectively relaxing the imposed restrictions and total about 200,000 individuals (as of March 25, 2020).

A central issue has been the persistent assumption that publics require a base of scientific knowledge for science to have broad cultural meaning. Yet, recent advances in cultural and cognitive sociology point to alternative research programs seeking to identify how publics come to understand complex and uncertain issues, when information is incomplete and asymmetric. We use this approach to analyze data on public perceptions of how scientific different fields are from the 2006 and 2012 National Science Foundation’s Science and Technology Survey. Our multivariate analyses allow us to approximate how mass publics map the social space of scientific professions, while accounting for individuals’ social location and cultural identity (e.g., race, class, gender, age, scientific sophistication, and political ideology). We then focus our attention on public perceptions of sociology and economics. Overall, we find that public perceptions, rather than being disorganized, map onto recognizable dimensions indicating how publics distinguish between scientific professions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,12,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Gauchat","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Andrews","given":"Kenneth T."}],"citation-key":"gauchatCulturalCognitiveMappingScientific2018","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/0003122418773353","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"567-595","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Cultural-Cognitive Mapping of Scientific Professions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122418773353","volume":"83"},

To this end, 14,000,000 documents indexed in Thomson Reuters's Web of Science (WoS) were studied to provide a state-of-the-art description of scientific collaborations across the world. The results indicate that the number of authors in the largest research teams have not significantly grown during the past decade; however, the number of smaller research teams has seen significant increases in growth. In terms of composition, the largest teams have become more diverse than the latter teams and tend more toward interinstitutional and international collaboration. Investigating the size of teams showed large variation between fields. Mapping scientific cooperation at the country level reveals that Western countries situated at the core of the map are extensively cooperating with each other.

The field of High- Energy Physics (HEP) has explored alternative communication strategies for decades, initially via the mass mailing of paper copies of preliminary manuscripts, then via the inception of the first online repositories and digital libraries. This field is uniquely placed to answer recurrent questions raised by the current trends in scholarly communication: is there an advantage for scientists to make their work available through repositories, often in preliminary form? Is there an advantage to publishing in Open Access journals? Do scientists still read journals or do they use digital repositories? The analysis of citation data demonstrates that free and immediate online dissemination of preprints creates an immense citation advantage in HEP, whereas publication in Open Access journals presents no discernible advantage. In addition, the analysis of clickstreams in the leading digital library of the field shows that HEP scientists seldom read journals, preferring preprints instead.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Gentil-Beccot","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Mele","given":"Salvatore"},{"family":"Brooks","given":"Travis"}],"citation-key":"gentil-beccotCitingReadingBehaviours2009","container-title":"arXiv:0906.5418 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,6,30]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Citing and Reading Behaviours in High-Energy Physics.

Bourdieu has often been misread as an ahistorical ‘reproduction theorist’ whose work does not allow for diachronic change or human agency. The article argues that both reproduction and social change, constraint and freedom, are at the heart of Bourdieu’s project. Bourdieu’s key concepts — habitus, field, cultural and symbolic capital — are all inherently historical. Bourdieu deploys his basic categories using a distinctly historicist social epistemology organized around the ideas of conjuncture, contingency, overdetermination, and radical discontinuity. The origins of Bourdieu’s historicism are traced to his teachers at the École Normale Supérieure and to the long-standing aspirations among French historians and sociologists to unify the two disciplines. The historical nature of Bourdieu’s work is also signalled by its pervasive influence on historians and the historical work of his former students and colleagues.

In Germany, the relationships between profit orientation, price and quality of nursing homes have not been investigated. We performed an observational study using secondary data from statutory quality audits of all nursing homes in Germany. The relationships were analyzed bivariately via Mann–Whitney U-Test and Kruskal-Wallis Test respectively, followed by a multivariate variance analysis which also covered the interaction effect between quality, price and type of ownership. 41 % of 10,168 German nursing homes were for-profit charging on average about 10 % less than not-for-profit homes. In five out of six quality categories under study, for-profit nursing homes provided lower quality than not-for-profit homes. Quality of care in all quality categories improved with increasing prices per day.

  {"id":"gevenRoleIntergenerationalNetworks2020","abstract":"In this article, we study the relationship between intergenerational networks in classrooms (i.e., relationships among parents in classrooms, and between parents and their children’s classmates) and students’ grades. Using panel data on complete classroom networks of approximately 3,000 adolescents and their parents in approximately 200 classes in both Germany and the Netherlands, we compare estimates based on between-student differences in intergenerational networks (i.e., between-individual estimates) to estimates based on changes students experience in their intergenerational networks over time (i.e., within-individual estimates). We also examine how the relationship between intergenerational networks and grades is contingent on students’ location in the educational system (i.e., their ability track). When considering between-individual estimates, we find some support for a positive relationship between intergenerational networks and grades. However, we find no robust support when considering within-individual estimates. The findings suggest that between-individual estimates, which most previous research has relied on, may be confounded by unobserved differences across individuals. We find little support for variations in these estimates across ability tracks. We discuss the implications for Coleman’s social capital theory on intergenerational closure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Geven","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Werfhorst","given":"Herman G.","non-dropping-particle":"van de"}],"citation-key":"gevenRoleIntergenerationalNetworks2020","container-title":"Sociology of Education","container-title-short":"Sociol Educ","DOI":"10.1177/0038040719882309","ISSN":"0038-0407","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"40-64","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Role of Intergenerational Networks in Students’ School Performance in Two Differentiated Educational Systems: A Comparison of Between- and Within-Individual Estimates","title-short":"The Role of Intergenerational Networks in Students’ School Performance in Two Differentiated Educational Systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0038040719882309","volume":"93"},

  {"id":"giddensClassicalSocialTheory1976","abstract":"The object of this paper is both critical and constructive. The first section contains a critical account of some leading interpretations of the rise of modern sociology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Europe, concentrating primarily on Durkheim but refering also to Max Weber. I try to show that these interpretations, still very commonly held, have to be abandoned as myths. Like all myths, however, they contain a rational kernel, and in seeking to show what this might be, I indicate some lines of development which I consider to be important in sociology in the present day. Most characterizations of the current travails of social theory are concerned with issues of epistemology, that is, with problems of the sorts of \"truth claims\" that can be made in sociology. These matters, undeniably of pressing importance, are related to legacies from 19th-century social thought which we have to disavow. But there is another residue of the 19th century with which we have also to break: this is represented by what I cal the theory of industrial society. An essential task facing contemporary social theory is that of reconciling a revised epistemology of social science with new frameworks for the analysis of the development of advanced societies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Giddens","given":"Anthony"}],"citation-key":"giddensClassicalSocialTheory1976","container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1086/226140","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1976,1,1]]},"page":"703-729","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Classical Social Theory and the Origins of Modern Sociology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/226140","volume":"81"},

Such questions - and the judgments required to answer them - are woven into the fabric of everyday experience. This book, first published in 2002, examines how people make such judgments. The study of human judgment was transformed in the 1970s, when Kahneman and Tversky introduced their 'heuristics and biases' approach and challenged the dominance of strictly rational models. Their work highlighted the reflexive mental operations used to make complex problems manageable and illuminated how the same processes can lead to both accurate and dangerously flawed judgments. The heuristics and biases framework generated a torrent of influential research in psychology - research that reverberated widely and affected scholarship in economics, law, medicine, management, and political science. This book compiles the most influential research in the heuristics and biases tradition since the initial collection of 1982 (by Kahneman, Slovic, and Tversky).","author":[{"family":"Gilovich","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Griffin","given":"Dale"},{"family":"Kahneman","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"gilovichHeuristicsBiasesPsychology2002","event-place":"Cambridge, U.K. ; New York","ISBN":"978-0-521-79679-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,7,8]]},"language":"Englisch","number-of-pages":"882","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, U.K. ; New York","source":"Amazon","title":"Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment","title-short":"Heuristics and Biases","type":"book"},

This relationship is moderated by the house’s inward centrality in a network of personnel mobility stemming from hiring competitors’ employees, the tenure of its creative directors, the accomplishments of these directors, and the house’s status. Our results suggest that organizations can enhance their creativity by relying on ideas obtained through relationships with their former employees long after these employees left to work for the competition.

  {"id":"godartSociologyCreativityElements2020","abstract":"This review integrates diverse characterizations of creativity from a sociological perspective with the goal of reinvigorating discussion of the sociology of creativity. We start by exploring relevant works of classical social theory to uncover key assumptions and principles, which are used as a theoretical basis for our proposed definition of creativity: an intentional configuration of cultural and material elements that is unexpected for a given audience.

Only rare randomized or natural experiments can assess the real causal effect of social capital. This paper relies on data from one such experiment: faculty recruitment at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) between 1960 and 2005, a leading French institution of higher education in the social sciences. It exploits the fact that the electoral commission, a hiring committee which produces a first ranking of applicants, is partly composed of faculty members drawn at random. It shows that when the PhD advisor is randomly drawn, it doubles the chances of an applicant of being shortlisted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Godechot","given":"Olivier"}],"citation-key":"godechotChanceInfluenceNatural2016","container-title":"Social Networks","container-title-short":"Social Networks","DOI":"10.1016/j.socnet.2016.02.002","ISSN":"0378-8733","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7]]},"page":"60-75","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The chance of influence: A natural experiment on the role of social capital in faculty recruitment","title-short":"The chance of influence","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873316000113","volume":"46"},
  {"id":"goelPredictingConsumerBehavior2010","abstract":"Recent work has demonstrated that Web search volume can “predict the present,” meaning that it can be used to accurately track outcomes such as unemployment levels, auto and home sales, and disease prevalence in near real time. Here we show that what consumers are searching for online can also predict their collective future behavior days or even weeks in advance. Specifically we use search query volume to forecast the opening weekend box-office revenue for feature films, first-month sales of video games, and the rank of songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, finding in all cases that search counts are highly predictive of future outcomes. We also find that search counts generally boost the performance of baseline models fit on other publicly available data, where the boost varies from modest to dramatic, depending on the application in question. Finally, we reexamine previous work on tracking flu trends and show that, perhaps surprisingly, the utility of search data relative to a simple autoregressive model is modest. We conclude that in the absence of other data sources, or where small improvements in predictive performance are material, search queries provide a useful guide to the near future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Goel","given":"Sharad"},{"family":"Hofman","given":"Jake M."},{"family":"Lahaie","given":"Sébastien"},{"family":"Pennock","given":"David M."},{"family":"Watts","given":"Duncan J."}],"citation-key":"goelPredictingConsumerBehavior2010","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1005962107","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"41","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,12,10]]},"language":"en","page":"17486-17490","PMID":"20876140","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Predicting consumer behavior with Web search","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/107/41/17486","volume":"107"},
  {"id":"goldbergFittingStandingOut2016","abstract":"A recurring theme in sociological research is the tradeoff between fitting in and standing out. Prior work examining this tension tends to take either a structural or a cultural perspective. We fuse these two traditions to develop a theory of how structural and cultural embeddedness jointly relate to individual attainment within organizations. Given that organizational culture is hard to observe, we develop a novel approach to assessing individuals’ cultural fit with their colleagues based on the language expressed in internal e-mail communications. Drawing on a unique dataset that includes a corpus of 10.24 million e-mail messages exchanged over five years among 601 employees in a high-technology firm, we find that network constraint impedes, whereas cultural fit promotes, individual attainment. More importantly, we find evidence of a tradeoff between the two forms of embeddedness: cultural fit benefits individuals with low network constraint (i.e., brokers), whereas network constraint promotes attainment for people with low cultural fit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Amir"},{"family":"Srivastava","given":"Sameer B."},{"family":"Manian","given":"V.

Two criteria based on age are demographic: lives saved and years of future life saved. Vaccinating the very old against COVID-19 saves the most lives, but, since older age is accompanied by falling life expectancy, it is widely supposed that these two goals are in conflict. We show this to be mistaken. The age patterns of COVID-19 mortality are such that vaccinating the oldest first saves the most lives and, surprisingly, also maximizes years of remaining life expectancy.

  {"id":"gontisConsentaneousAgentBasedStochastic2014","abstract":"We are looking for the agent-based treatment of the financial markets considering necessity to build bridges between microscopic, agent based, and macroscopic, phenomenological modeling. The acknowledgment that agent-based modeling framework, which may provide qualitative and quantitative understanding of the financial markets, is very ambiguous emphasizes the exceptional value of well defined analytically tractable agent systems. Herding as one of the behavior peculiarities considered in the behavioral finance is the main property of the agent interactions we deal with in this contribution. Looking for the consentaneous agent-based and macroscopic approach we combine two origins of the noise: exogenous one, related to the information flow, and endogenous one, arising form the complex stochastic dynamics of agents. As a result we propose a three state agent-based herding model of the financial markets. From this agent-based model we derive a set of stochastic differential equations, which describes underlying macroscopic dynamics of agent population and log price in the financial markets. The obtained solution is then subjected to the exogenous noise, which shapes instantaneous return fluctuations. We test both Gaussian and q-Gaussian noise as a source of the short term fluctuations. The resulting model of the return in the financial markets with the same set of parameters reproduces empirical probability and spectral densities of absolute return observed in New York, Warsaw and NASDAQ OMX Vilnius Stock Exchanges. Our result confirms the prevalent idea in behavioral finance that herding interactions may be dominant over agent rationality and contribute towards bubble formation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Gontis","given":"Vygintas"},{"family":"Kononovicius","given":"Aleksejus"}],"citation-key":"gontisConsentaneousAgentBasedStochastic2014","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102201","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,7,16]]},"PMCID":"PMC4100891","PMID":"25029364","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Consentaneous Agent-Based and Stochastic Model of the Financial Markets","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4100891/","volume":"9"},

We examine articles in 10 sociology journals in 1974-83. Most articles have been quantitative, but female authors have used qualitative methods more often than males. Writing about gender increased rather than decreased the likelihood of having used quantitative methods for both women and men.

We describe a generative model for documents, introduced by Blei, Ng, and Jordan [Blei, D. M., Ng, A. Y. & Jordan, M. I. (2003) J. Machine Learn. Res. 3, 993-1022], in which each document is generated by choosing a distribution over topics and then choosing each word in the document from a topic selected according to this distribution. We then present a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference in this model. We use this algorithm to analyze abstracts from PNAS by using Bayesian model selection to establish the number of topics. We show that the extracted topics capture meaningful structure in the data, consistent with the class designations provided by the authors of the articles, and outline further applications of this analysis, including identifying “hot topics” by examining temporal dynamics and tagging abstracts to illustrate semantic content.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,8,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Thomas L."},{"family":"Steyvers","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"griffithsFindingScientificTopics2004","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0307752101","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"suppl 1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,6,4]]},"language":"en","page":"5228-5235","PMID":"14872004","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Finding scientific topics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/101/suppl_1/5228","volume":"101"},

Studies of representation focus on a disaggregated level: the electoral connection between representatives and constituents. But there is a collective level of representation—the result of aggregating across representatives. This article uses new measures of home styles to demonstrate that responsiveness to constituents can have negative consequences for collective representation. The electoral connection causes marginal representatives—legislators with districts composed of the other party's partisans—to emphasize appropriations in their home styles. But it causes aligned representatives—those with districts filled with copartisans—to build their home styles around position taking. Aggregated across representatives, this results in an artificial polarization in stated party positions: aligned representatives, who tend to be ideologically extreme, dominate policy debates. The logic and evidence in this article provide an explanation for the apparent rise in vitriolic debate, and the new measures facilitate a literature on home styles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Grimmer","given":"Justin"}],"citation-key":"grimmerAppropriatorsNotPosition2013","container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","DOI":"10.1111/ajps.12000","ISSN":"1540-5907","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ajps.12000","page":"624-642","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Appropriators not Position Takers: The Distorting Effects of Electoral Incentives on Congressional Representation","title-short":"Appropriators not Position Takers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12000","volume":"57"},

We explain how the inclusion of machine learning in the social sciences requires us to rethink not only applications of machine learning methods but also best practices in the social sciences. In contrast to the traditional tasks for machine learning in computer science and statistics, when machine learning is applied to social scientific data, it is used to discover new concepts, measure the prevalence of those concepts, assess causal effects, and make predictions. The abundance of data and resources facilitates the move away from a deductive social science to a more sequential, interactive, and ultimately inductive approach to inference. We explain how an agnostic approach to machine learning methods focused on the social science tasks facilitates progress across a wide range of questions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Grimmer","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Roberts","given":"Margaret E."},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Brandon M."}],"citation-key":"grimmerMachineLearningSocial2021","container-title":"Annual Review of Political Science","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-polisci-053119-015921","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-polisci-053119-015921","page":"395-419","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Machine Learning for Social Science: An Agnostic Approach","title-short":"Machine Learning for Social Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-polisci-053119-015921","volume":"24"},

Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods—they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must contribute new methods and new methods of validation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Grimmer","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Brandon M."}],"citation-key":"grimmerTextDataPromise2013","container-title":"Political Analysis","DOI":"10.1093/pan/mps028","ISSN":"1047-1987, 1476-4989","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,7]]},"page":"267-297","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Text as Data: The Promise and Pitfalls of Automatic Content Analysis Methods for Political Texts","title-short":"Text as Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/div-classtitletext-as-data-the-promise-and-pitfalls-of-automatic-content-analysis-methods-for-political-textsdiv/F7AAC8B2909441603FEB25C156448F20","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"grothIntradayMarketRisk2011","abstract":"The management of financial risk is one of the most challenging tasks of financial institutions. In the last two decades, diverse quantitative models and approaches have been developed and refined to address the impact of volatile markets on business. Whereas existing approaches have intensively utilized structured data such as historical price series, little attention has been paid to unstructured (textual) data, which could be a large source of information in this context. Previous empirical research has shown that certain news stories, such as corporate disclosures, can cause abnormal price behavior subsequent to their publication. On the basis of a data set comprising such news stories as well as intraday stock prices, this paper explores the risk implications of information being newly available to market participants. After showing that such events can significantly drive stock price volatilities, this research aims at identifying among the textual data provided those disclosures that have resulted in most supranormal risk exposures. To this end, four different learners — Naïve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbour, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine — have been applied in order to detect patterns in the textual data that could explain increased risk exposure. Two evaluations are presented in order to assess the learning capabilities of the approach in the context of risk management. First, “classic” data mining evaluation metrics are applied and, second, a newly developed simulation-based evaluation method is presented. Evaluation results provide strong evidence that unstructured (textual) data represents a valuable source of information also for financial risk management — a domain in which, in the past, little attention has been paid to unstructured data. With regard to classification performance, it is also shown that there exist significant differences between the applied learning techniques.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Groth","given":"Sven S."},{"family":"Muntermann","given":"Jan"}],"citation-key":"grothIntradayMarketRisk2011","collection-title":"Enterprise Risk and Security Management: Data, Text and Web Mining","container-title":"Decision Support Systems","container-title-short":"Decision Support Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.dss.2010.08.019","ISSN":"0167-9236","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,3]]},"page":"680-691","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"An intraday market risk management approach based on textual analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923610001430","volume":"50"},

Although large, established firms have generally not cut their dividends, they also show a higher propensity to pay out cash through repurchases.

  {"id":"guillenNewEconomicSociology2005","abstract":"As the American economy surged in the 1990s, economic sociology made great strides as well. Economists and sociologists worked across disciplinary boundaries to study the booming market as both a product and a producer of culture, tracing the correlations they saw between economic and social phenomena. In the process, they debated the methodological issues that arose from their interdisciplinary perspectives. The New Economic Sociology provides an overview of these debates and assesses the state of the burgeoning discipline. The contributors summarize economic sociology's accomplishments to date, identifying key theoretical problems and opportunities, and formulating strategies for future research in the field. The book opens with an introduction to the main debates and conceptual approaches in economic sociology. Contributor Neil Fligstein suggests that the current resurgence of interest in economic sociology is due to the way it brings together many sociological subdisciplines including the study of markets, households, labor markets, stratification, networks, and culture. Other contributors examine the role of economic phenomena from a network perspective. Ron Burt, for example, demonstrates how social relationships affect competitive dynamics in the marketplace. A third set of chapters addresses the role of gender in economic sociology. In her chapter, Barbara Reskin rethinks conventional notions about discrimination and points out that the law only covers one type of discrimination, while in recent years social scientists have uncovered other forms of hidden discrimination, which must be addressed as well. The New Economic Sociology also addresses the problem of economic development and change from a sociological perspective. Alejandro Portes and Margarita Mooney elaborate on one of the key emerging concepts in economic sociology, arguing that social capital—as an attribute of communities and regions—can contribute to economic and social well-being by fostering collaboration and entrepreneurship.","citation-key":"guillenNewEconomicSociology2005","editor":[{"family":"Guillen","given":"Maruo F."},{"family":"Collins","given":"Randall"},{"family":"England","given":"Paula"}],"event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-61044-261-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,5,12]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"396","publisher":"Russell Sage Foundation","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Google Books","title":"The New Economic Sociology: Developments in an Emerging Field","title-short":"The New Economic Sociology","type":"book"},

  {"id":"guyonGeneSelectionCancer2002","abstract":"DNA micro-arrays now permit scientists to screen thousands of genes simultaneously and determine whether those genes are active, hyperactive or silent in normal or cancerous tissue. Because these new micro-array devices generate bewildering amounts of raw data, new analytical methods must be developed to sort out whether cancer tissues have distinctive signatures of gene expression over normal tissues or other types of cancer tissues.In this paper, we address the problem of selection of a small subset of genes from broad patterns of gene expression data, recorded on DNA micro-arrays. Using available training examples from cancer and normal patients, we build a classifier suitable for genetic diagnosis, as well as drug discovery. Previous attempts to address this problem select genes with correlation techniques. We propose a new method of gene selection utilizing Support Vector Machine methods based on Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). We demonstrate experimentally that the genes selected by our techniques yield better classification performance and are biologically relevant to cancer.In contrast with the baseline method, our method eliminates gene redundancy automatically and yields better and more compact gene subsets. In patients with leukemia our method discovered 2 genes that yield zero leave-one-out error, while 64 genes are necessary for the baseline method to get the best result (one leave-one-out error). In the colon cancer database, using only 4 genes our method is 98% accurate, while the baseline method is only 86% accurate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Guyon","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Weston","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Barnhill","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Vapnik","given":"Vladimir"}],"citation-key":"guyonGeneSelectionCancer2002","container-title":"Machine Learning","container-title-short":"Machine Learning","DOI":"10.1023/A:1012487302797","ISSN":"0885-6125, 1573-0565","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"language":"en","page":"389-422","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Gene Selection for Cancer Classification using Support Vector Machines","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012487302797","volume":"46"},

How have they managed to restructure the economy to reap the lion's share, tearing new holes in the safety net and saddling all of us with increased debt and risk?  In this book the authors trace the rise of the winner-take-all economy back to a major transformation of American politics in the late 1970s, under a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress. With big business and conservative ideologues organizing themselves to undo the regulations and progressive tax policies that had helped ensure a fair distribution of economic rewards, deregulation got under way, taxes were cut for the wealthiest, and business decisively defeated labor in Washington. And this transformation continued under Reagan and the Bushes as well as Clinton, with both parties caterin to the interests of those at the very top.  Here the authors show how a political system that traditionally has been responsive to the middle class has been hijacked bythe super rich.  In doing so, it not only changes how we view American politics, but also points the way to rebuilding a democracy that serves the interests of the many rather than just those of the wealthy few.","author":[{"family":"Hacker","given":"Jacob S"},{"family":"Pierson","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"hackerWinnertakeallPoliticsHow2010","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-4165-8869-6 1-4165-8869-8 978-1-4165-8870-2 1-4165-8870-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"English","publisher":"Simon & Schuster","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Winner-take-all politics: how Washington made the rich richer-and turned its back on the middle class","title-short":"Winner-take-all politics","type":"book"},

  {"id":"haeusslerDivisionLaborCollaborative2020","abstract":"Teams performing scientific research are becoming increasingly large and interdisciplinary. While prior work has examined antecedents and performance implications of these trends, it is not clear how size and interdisciplinarity relate to teams’ internal organization, especially the division of labor (DoL) between members. We first develop an organizing framework that integrates three complementary dimensions of DoL: (1) the specialization of individual team members, (2) the distribution of activities across team members, and (3) interdependencies between activities. We then discuss how these aspects of DoL are related to team size and interdisciplinarity and test our hypotheses using author contribution data from over 12,000 scientific articles. We find that team size has a positive relationship with an aggregate measure of DoL, but disaggregated measures show that this relationship holds for some aspects of DoL and not others. We also find that interdisciplinary teams use greater division of labor, although this effect depends on the degree to which interdisciplinarity is intra- versus inter-personal. We conclude by discussing how our conceptual and empirical toolkit may be applied in future research on the drivers and consequences of division of labor in teams.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Haeussler","given":"Carolin"},{"family":"Sauermann","given":"Henry"}],"citation-key":"haeusslerDivisionLaborCollaborative2020","container-title":"Research Policy","container-title-short":"Research Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.respol.2020.103987","ISSN":"0048-7333","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"103987","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Division of labor in collaborative knowledge production: The role of team size and interdisciplinarity","title-short":"Division of labor in collaborative knowledge production","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733320300676","volume":"49"},

  {"id":"hagemannComplexProblemSolving2017","abstract":"Complex problem solving is challenging and a high-level cognitive process for individuals. When analyzing complex problem solving in teams, an additional, new dimension has to be considered, as teamwork processes increase the requirements already put on individual team members. After introducing an idealized teamwork process model, that complex problem solving teams pass through, and integrating the relevant teamwork skills for interdependently working teams into the model and combining it with the four kinds of team processes (transition, action, interpersonal, and learning processes), the paper demonstrates the importance of fulfilling team process demands for successful complex problem solving within teams. Therefore, results from a controlled team study within complex situations are presented. The study focused on factors that influence action processes, like coordination, such as emergent states like collective orientation, cohesion, and trust and that dynamically enable effective teamwork in complex situations. Before conducting the experiments, participants were divided by median split into two-person teams with either high (n = 58) or low (n = 58) collective orientation values. The study was conducted with the microworld C3Fire, simulating dynamic decision making, and acting in complex situations within a teamwork context. The microworld includes interdependent tasks such as extinguishing forest fires or protecting houses. Two firefighting scenarios had been developed, which takes a maximum of 15 min each. All teams worked on these two scenarios. Coordination within the team and the resulting team performance were calculated based on a log-file analysis. The results show that no relationships between trust and action processes and team performance exist. Likewise, no relationships were found for cohesion. Only collective orientation of team members positively influences team performance in complex environments mediated by action processes such as coordination within the team. The results are discussed in relation to previous empirical findings and to learning processes within the team with a focus on feedback strategies.","author":[{"family":"Hagemann","given":"Vera"},{"family":"Kluge","given":"Annette"}],"citation-key":"hagemannComplexProblemSolving2017","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front Psychol","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01730","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"eng","page":"1730","PMCID":"PMC5627219","PMID":"29033886","source":"PubMed","title":"Complex Problem Solving in Teams: The Impact of Collective Orientation on Team Process Demands","title-short":"Complex Problem Solving in Teams","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

Accordingly, we enhance existing text mining methods by using more expressive features to represent text and by employing market feedback as part of our feature selection process. We show that a robust feature selection allows lifting classification accuracies significantly above previous approaches when combined with complex feature types. This is because our approach allows selecting semantically relevant features and thus, reduces the problem of over-fitting when applying a machine learning approach. We also demonstrate that our approach is highly profitable for trading in practice.

This paper develops an approach to institutional change more extended than the one provided in Hall and Soskice (in Varieties of Capitalism: The Institutional Foundations of Comparative Advantage, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2001) but congruent with its varieties-of-capitalism perspective. It begins by outlining an approach to institutional stability, which suggests that the persistence of institutions depends not only on their aggregate welfare effects but also on the distributive benefits that they provide to the underlying social or political coalitions; and not only on the Pareto-optimal quality of such equilibria but also on continuous processes of mobilization through which the actors test the limits of the existing institutions. It then develops an analysis of institutional change that emphasizes the ways in which defection, reinterpretation and reform emerge out of such contestation and assesses the accuracy of this account against recent developments in the political economies of Europe. The paper concludes by outlining the implications of this perspective for contemporary analyses of liberalization in the political economy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Hall","given":"Peter A."},{"family":"Thelen","given":"Kathleen"}],"citation-key":"hallInstitutionalChangeVarieties2009a","container-title":"Socio-Economic Review","container-title-short":"Socioecon Rev","DOI":"10.1093/ser/mwn020","ISSN":"1475-1461, 1475-147X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"7-34","source":"ser.oxfordjournals.org","title":"Institutional change in varieties of capitalism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ser.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/1/7","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"hamoudaBoardDirectorsInsider2013","abstract":"This study examines the relationship between insider trading and board of directors’ characteristics around stock repurchase announcements. It is hypothesized that information disparity between insiders and shareholders from share repurchases announcements creates opportunities for insiders to time their trading. However, there is little evidence on whether board characteristics reduce the probability of insider trading with repurchase announcements. Using data from firms listed on Forbes 500 between 1998 and 2004, we found that insider trading is related to share repurchase announcements. In order to focus on board of directors’ role, we controlled for board characteristics that may change the repurchase decision. Our results provide corroborative evidence of insider net selling around repurchase announcements and the advantages of board characteristics to offset insider trading. In particular, the results suggest that board tenure, directors’ ownership and board directorship change positively insider trading around repurchase announcements. Hence, Securities and Exchange Commission should consider rigorous restrictions on share repurchase announcements and be aware of potential influence of the corporate governance device.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Hamouda","given":"Foued"},{"family":"Arab","given":"Mounira Ben"}],"citation-key":"hamoudaBoardDirectorsInsider2013","container-title":"Journal of Management & Governance","container-title-short":"J Manag Gov","DOI":"10.1007/s10997-011-9181-6","ISSN":"1385-3457, 1572-963X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"405-418","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Board of directors and insider trading with share repurchase programs","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10997-011-9181-6","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"handDisciplinarySchismsSubspecialty1999","abstract":"One component of the often discussed malaise in sociology has been the problem of subspecialty \"drift\" – applied specialties given birth originally within the field now forming separate departments or programs. The historical and ideological origins of this problem are discussed, focusing primarily on the schism early on in sociology between pure and applied work. Anecdotal evidence presented from interviews with faculty in social work and criminal justice programs suggests sociology has in many cases facilitated development of new programs. In order to evaluate the relative position of applied programs within departments of sociology, a comparative analysis of the 1986 and 1996 Guide to Graduate Departments of Sociology \"special program\" and department titles is undertaken. Contrary to the perception that applied programs are leaving sociology, results indicate an overall increase in special programs with an applied or practice component. Furthermore, masters programs are significantly more likely to have changed department names and to be in combined departments than doctoral programs. We suggest that while sociology has lost ground in the applied arena to more practice and policy-oriented disciplines, program changes within departments in the past decade may help to stem further subspecialty drift. The article concludes by suggesting that state sociological associations are particularly well suited to play a leadership role in addressing these issues.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hand","given":"Carl M."},{"family":"Judkins","given":"Ben"}],"citation-key":"handDisciplinarySchismsSubspecialty1999","container-title":"The American Sociologist","ISSN":"0003-1232","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999]]},"page":"18-36","publisher":"Springer","source":"JSTOR","title":"Disciplinary Schisms: Subspecialty \"Drift\" and the Fragmentation of Sociology","title-short":"Disciplinary Schisms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/27698901","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"hannanConceptsCategoriesFoundations2019","abstract":"Why do people like books, music, or movies that adhere consistently to genre conventions? Why is it hard for politicians to take positions that cross ideological boundaries? Why do we have dramatically different expectations of companies that are categorized as social media platforms as opposed to news media sites? The answers to these questions require an understanding of how people use basic concepts in their everyday lives to give meaning to objects, other people, and social situations and actions.In this book, a team of sociologists presents a groundbreaking model of concepts and categorization that can guide sociological and cultural analysis of a wide variety of social situations. Drawing on research in various fields, including cognitive science, computational linguistics, and psychology, the book develops an innovative view of concepts. It argues that concepts have meanings that are probabilistic rather than sharp, occupying fuzzy, overlapping positions in a “conceptual space.” Measurements of distances in this space reveal our mental representations of categories. Using this model, important yet commonplace phenomena such as our routine buying decisions can be quantified in terms of the cognitive distance between concepts. Concepts and Categories provides an essential set of formal theoretical tools and illustrates their application using an eclectic set of methodologies, from micro-level controlled experiments to macro-level language processing. It illuminates how explicit attention to concepts and categories can give us a new understanding of everyday situations and interactions.","author":[{"family":"Hannan","given":"Michael T."},{"family":"Mens","given":"Gaël Le"},{"family":"Hsu","given":"Greta"},{"family":"Kovács","given":"Balázs"},{"family":"Negro","given":"Giacomo"},{"family":"Pólos","given":"László"},{"family":"Pontikes","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Sharkey","given":"Amanda J."}],"citation-key":"hannanConceptsCategoriesFoundations2019","ISBN":"978-0-231-54993-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8]]},"page":"328 Pages","publisher":"Columbia University Press","source":"Columbia University Press","title":"Concepts and Categories: Foundations for Sociological and Cultural Analysis","title-short":"Concepts and Categories","type":"book"},

  {"id":"hansenWealthAccumulationOpportunity2021","abstract":"Although the Scandinavian countries are often considered to epitomize social democratic governance, Scandinavia’s profound wealth inequalities, seen in relation to the more modest income differences, constitutes a fascinating paradox. Drawing on class theoretical concerns with strategies for reproduction and a Bourdieusian emphasis on class fractions, we explore how class-origin wealth gaps evolved over the past 25 years in Norway, and how they compare to class-origin income gaps. First, we find that class-origin wealth gaps have increased in recent years, whereas income inequalities are fairly persistent among men, and increasing among women. We find that educational attainment is important for channeling income inequality, but that education is less important for understanding wealth gaps. Second, we document differences between people whose family contexts were most highly endowed with economic capital and those who grew up in families that were engaged in cultural fields or the professions. Finally, we highlight how analyses based solely on net worth neglect important ways class origin perpetuates and accelerates wealth inequalities via the acquisition of debt. We argue that recent decades have fostered new instruments for opportunity hoarding that are most successfully used by the sons and daughters of the economic upper class.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Hansen","given":"Marianne Nordli"},{"family":"Toft","given":"Maren"}],"citation-key":"hansenWealthAccumulationOpportunity2021","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/00031224211020012","ISSN":"0003-1224","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,26]]},"language":"en","page":"00031224211020012","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Wealth Accumulation and Opportunity Hoarding: Class-Origin Wealth Gaps over a Quarter of a Century in a Scandinavian Country","title-short":"Wealth Accumulation and Opportunity Hoarding","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224211020012"},

Living the Drama takes a close look at three neighborhoods in Boston to analyze the many complex ways that the context of community shapes the daily lives and long-term prospects of inner-city boys.David J. Harding studied sixty adolescent boys growing up in two very poor areas and one working-class area. In the first two, violence and neighborhood identification are inextricably linked as rivalries divide the city into spaces safe, neutral, or dangerous. Consequently, Harding discovers, social relationships are determined by residential space. Older boys who can navigate the dangers of the streets serve as role models, and friendships between peers grow out of mutual protection. The impact of community goes beyond the realm of same-sex bonding, Harding reveals, affecting the boys’ experiences in school and with the opposite sex. A unique glimpse into the world of urban adolescent boys, Living the Drama paints a detailed, insightful portrait of life in the inner city.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Harding","given":"David J."}],"citation-key":"hardingLivingDrama2010","event-place":"Chicago","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"publisher":"University of Chicago Press","publisher-place":"Chicago","source":"www.press.uchicago.edu","title":"Living the Drama","type":"book","URL":"https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/L/bo8380997.html"},

Many big data studies rely on traces of people’s behavior on social media platforms such as opinions expressed through Twitter posts. How representative are such data? Whose voices are most likely to show up on such sites? Analyzing survey data about a national sample of American adults’ social network site usage, this article examines what user characteristics are associated with the adoption of such sites. Findings suggest that several sociodemographic factors relate to who adopts such sites. Those of higher socioeconomic status are more likely to be on several platforms suggesting that big data derived from social media tend to oversample the views of more privileged people. Additionally, Internet skills are related to using such sites, again showing that opinions visible on these sites do not represent all types of people equally. The article cautions against relying on content from such sites as the sole basis of data to avoid disproportionately ignoring the perspectives of the less privileged. Whether business interests or policy considerations, it is important that decisions that concern the whole population are not based on the results of analyses that favor the opinions of those who are already better off.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Hargittai","given":"Eszter"}],"citation-key":"hargittaiPotentialBiasesBig2020","container-title":"Social Science Computer Review","container-title-short":"Social Science Computer Review","DOI":"10.1177/0894439318788322","ISSN":"0894-4393","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"10-24","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Potential Biases in Big Data: Omitted Voices on Social Media","title-short":"Potential Biases in Big Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439318788322","volume":"38"},

  {"id":"harringtonPopFinanceInvestment2008","abstract":"During the 1990s, the United States underwent a dramatic transformation: investing in stocks, once the province of a privileged elite, became a mass activity involving more than half of Americans. \"Pop Finance\" follows the trajectory of this new market populism via the rise of investment clubs, through which millions of individuals from across the socioeconomic spectrum became investors for the first time. As sociologist Brooke Harrington shows, these new investors pour billions of dollars annually into the U.S. stock market and hold significant positions in some of the nation’s largest firms. Drawing upon Harrington’s long-term observation of investment clubs along with in-depth interviews and extensive survey data, \"Pop Finance\" is the first book to examine the origins and impact of this mass engagement in investing. Among Harrington’s most intriguing findings is that gender-based differences in investing can create a “diversity premium”—groups of men and women together are more profitable than single-sex groups. In examining the sources of this effect, she delves into the interpersonal dynamics that distinguish effective decision-making groups from their dysfunctional counterparts. In addition, Harrington shows that most Americans approach investing not only to make a profit but also to make a statement. In effect, portfolios have become like consumer products, serving both utilitarian and social ends. This ties into the growth of socially responsible investing and shareholder activism—matters relevant not only to social scientists but also to corporate leaders, policymakers, and the millions of Americans planning for retirement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Harrington","given":"Elisabeth Brooke"}],"citation-key":"harringtonPopFinanceInvestment2008","event-place":"Princeton","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton","source":"works.bepress.com","title":"Pop Finance: Investment Clubs and the New Investor Populism","title-short":"Pop Finance","type":"book","URL":"http://works.bepress.com/brooke_harrington/9"},

  {"id":"hayNormalizingRoleRationalist2004","abstract":"The political economy of Britain over the past three decades provides an interesting example of the consolidation, normalization and institutionalization of a new economic paradigm ? neoliberalism. As such, it serves as a potentially instructive focus for debate both about the conditions under which economic paradigms are replaced and consolidated and the evolution of such paradigms through the process of institutionalization. In this paper I suggest that the institutionalization of this new economic paradigm has been associated with the shift from a normative to a normalized and necessitarian neoliberalism. I examine the role played by rationalist assumptions in this extended process of normalization-institutionalization. After presenting a stylized account of the evolution of British neoliberalism, I show how New Labour's monetary policy regime is the heir to the legacy of monetarism and its agenda of labour-market reform is the heir to Thatcherism's supply-side economics. I suggest that the time-inconsistency thesis and the business school globalization thesis have played an equivalent role, for New Labour, to that played for the new right by monetarism and supply-side economics in legitimating neoliberalism. In this way neoliberalism has been normalized. In the final sections of the paper I reflect on the implications of the normalized and necessitarian character of neoliberalism in Britain for its contestability and for democratic economic governance more broadly.","author":[{"family":"Hay","given":"Colin"}],"citation-key":"hayNormalizingRoleRationalist2004","container-title":"Economy and Society","DOI":"10.1080/0308514042000285260","ISSN":"0308-5147","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"page":"500-527","source":"Taylor&Francis","title":"The normalizing role of rationalist assumptions in the institutional embedding of neoliberalism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0308514042000285260","volume":"33"},
  {"id":"hedefalkSocialContextNearest2020","abstract":"<p>We study the association between sociospatial neighborhood conditions throughout childhood and educational attainment in adulthood. Using unique longitudinal microdata for a medium-sized Swedish town, we geocode its population at the address level, 1939 to 1967, and link individuals to national registers, 1968 to 2015. Thus, we adopt a long-term perspective on the importance of nearby neighbors during a period when higher education expanded. Applying a method for estimating individual neighborhoods at the address level, we analyze the association between the geographically weighted social class of the nearest 6 to 100 childhood neighbors (ages 2 to 17), and the likelihood of obtaining a university degree by age 40, controlling for both family social class and school districts. We show that even when growing up in a town with relatively low economic inequality, the social class of the nearest same-age neighbors in childhood was associated with educational attainment, and that the associations were similar regardless of class origin. Growing up in low-class neighborhoods lowered educational attainment; growing up in high-class neighborhoods increased attainment. Social class and neighborhoods reinforced each other, implying that high-class children clustered with each other had much higher odds of obtaining a university degree than low-class children from low-class neighborhoods. Thus, even if all groups benefited from the great expansion of free higher education in Sweden (1960s to 1970s), the large inequalities between the classes and neighborhoods remained unchanged throughout the period. These findings show the importance of an advantageous background, both regarding the immediate family and the networks of nearby people of the same age.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Hedefalk","given":"Finn"},{"family":"Dribe","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"hedefalkSocialContextNearest2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1922532117","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,11]]},"language":"en","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"The social context of nearest neighbors shapes educational attainment regardless of class origin","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/06/10/1922532117"},

Based on the largest data set so far, the paper shows that repurchase programs have also been well established in the German business world in the meantime. Short-term market reactions are significantly positive and imply an informal, yet institutionalized rule of action for investors. However, both trends apply especially in times of negative markets and, generally, not in the long-run—which makes them a “bad signal” for private investors.

In this context, success is seen as getting a paper published in high impact journals of physical subdisciplines as compared to not getting it published at all or in rather peripheral journals only. To control the nested levels of authors and papers, and to consider the time elapsing between working paper and prominent journal publication we employ multilevel eventhistory models with various network measures as covariates. Our results show that the maintenance of even a moderate number of persistent ties is crucial for scientific success. Also, even with low volumes of social capital Physicists who occupy brokerage positions enhance their chances of articles in high impact journals significantly.

First, we carve out its capacity to handle “Big Data” in suitable formats. Second, we introduce programming libraries to analyze large networks and big text corpora, conduct simulations, and compare their performance to their counterparts in the R environment. Furthermore, we highlight practical tools implemented in Python for operational tasks like preparing presentations.

While the rise of digital media may have enabled more differences to be articulated, common ground is often seen as threatened by fragmentation of political debate, which some see as driven by news media. The relative importance of political actors (parties and politicians) in driving fragmentation has received less attention. In this paper, we compare how news media and political actors contribute to the fragmentation of online political debate on the basis of analysis of almost half a million election-related tweets collected during the 2017 French, German, and U.K. national elections. We employ a structural topic model to reduce online political debate to networks of topic overlap. Across the three countries with different political and media systems, we find news media are by far the most important actors in terms of creating and maintaining a common space of online political debate on Twitter. Our results also show that political actors, with some variation from country to country, contribute more to fragmentation as they focus on different topics while articulating clear differences. These findings underline the importance of complementing structural analysis of the rise of digital and social media with analysis of how important elite actors like news media and political parties/candidates use these media in different ways. Overall, we show how at least on Twitter, across three different countries with different media systems and political systems, news media create connection that contributes to commonality while political actors lay out clear differences that drive fragmentation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Heiberger","given":"Raphael"},{"family":"Majó-Vázquez","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Castro Herrero","given":"Laia"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Rasmus K."},{"family":"Esser","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"heibergerNotBlameMedia2021","container-title":"The International Journal of Press/Politics","container-title-short":"The International Journal of Press/Politics","DOI":"10.1177/19401612211015122","ISSN":"1940-1612","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,3]]},"language":"en","page":"19401612211015122","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Do Not Blame the Media!

The final model forecasts correctly all major recession and prosperity phases of the U.S. economy up to one year ahead. By employing different network measures on the level of corporations, we can also identify which companies’ stocks possess a key role in a changing economic environment and may be used as indication of critical (and prosperous) developments.

  {"id":"heidlerCognitiveSocialStructure2011","abstract":"Scientific collaboration can only be understood along the epistemic and cognitive grounding of scientific disciplines. New scientific discoveries in astrophysics led to a major restructuring of the elite network of astrophysics. To study the interplay of the epistemic grounding and the social network structure of a discipline, a mixed-methods approach is necessary. It combines scientometrics, quantitative network analysis and visualization tools with a qualitative network analysis approach. The centre of the international collaboration network of astrophysics is demarcated by identifying the 225 most productive astrophysicists. For the years 1998–1999 and 2001–2006 four co-authorship networks are constructed comprehending each a two year period. A visualization of the longitudinal network data gives first hints on the structural development of the network. The network of 2005–2006 is analyzed in depth. Based on cohesion analysis tools for network analysis, two main cores and three smaller ones are identified. Scientists in each core and additionally in structurally interesting positions are identified and 17 qualitative expert interviews are conducted with them. The visualization of the network of 2005–2006 is used in the interviews as a stimulus for the interviewees. An analysis of the three most often used keywords of the 225 astrophysicists is included and combined with the other data. The triangulation of these approaches shows that major epistemic changes in astrophysics, e.g. the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe, together with technical and organizational innovations, leads to a restructuring of the network of the discipline. The importance of a combination of qualitative and quantitative network analysis tools for the understanding of the interplay of cognitive and social structure in the sociology of science is substantiated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Heidler","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"heidlerCognitiveSocialStructure2011","container-title":"Minerva","container-title-short":"Minerva","DOI":"10.1007/s11024-011-9184-0","ISSN":"0026-4695, 1573-1871","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,11,20]]},"language":"en","page":"461-488","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Cognitive and Social Structure of the Elite Collaboration Network of Astrophysics: A Case Study on Shifting Network Structures","title-short":"Cognitive and Social Structure of the Elite Collaboration Network of Astrophysics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-011-9184-0","volume":"49"},

A longitudinal network analysis suggests that structure, cohesiveness, and interdisciplinarity vary considerably with the type of breakthrough and over time. Scientific progress appears to be multifaceted, including not only theoretical advances but also the discovery of new instrumentation and new matter.

Here we develop a model of pedestrian motion to explore the evolution of trails in urban green spaces such as parks. Our aim is to address such questions as what the topological structures of these trail systems are, and whether optimal path systems can be predicted for urban planning. We use an 'active walker' model that takes into account pedestrian motion and orientation and the concomitant feedbacks with the surrounding environment. Such models have previously been applied to the study of complex structure formation in physical, chemical and biological systems.

  {"id":"hennigFundierungNetzwerkperspektiveDurch2012","abstract":"Netzwerke nehmen eine Vermittlungsposition zwischen Mikro- und Makroebene ein, denn was wir als gesellschaftliche Realität wahrnehmen, spielt sich in Netzwerken oder durch Netzwerke ab. Ein wesentliches Problem in der Netzwerkforschung besteht bisher jedoch darin, dass soziale Netzwerke ofensichtlich über Strukturen verfügen, die zwar mit dem netzwerkanalytischen Instrumentarium adäquat beschrieben werden können, soziale Strukturen aber mehr umfassen als mit manifesten Interaktionsbeziehungen erfasst wird. Das heißt, dass die netzwerkanalytische Forschung zwar einen wichtigen Aspekt sozialer Strukturen erfasst, die Mikro- Makro-Problematik allerdings über soziale Beziehungsnetzwerke hinaus weist. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist das Ziel unseres Beitrages, die Netzwerkforschung stärker theoretisch zu fundieren und damit eine Grundlage für die gleichzeitige Berücksichtigung von Makro- und Mikroebene bei der Erklärung sozialen Handelns zu schaffen. Dazu verknüpfen wir Bourdieus Habitus- und Feldtheorie mit den Grundannahmen der Netzwerkforschung. Durch diese Verknüpfung wird es möglich, Netzwerkstrukturen als Muster sozialer Praktiken zu beschreiben, die durch mikro- und makrostrukturelle Merkmale wechselseitig hervorgebracht und beeinflusst werden. Mit Hilfe der egozentrierten Netzwerkanalyse konnten wir das geschaffene theoretische Fundament empirisch validieren. Im Zentrum der empirischen Untersuchung des Zusammenhangs von Habitus und Netzwerkstruktur stand die kombinierte Erhebung von Milieuzugehörigkeit, Gesellungsstilen und egozentrierten Netzwerken. Im Ergebnis zeigt sich, dass ein Großteil der Netzwerkstrukturmerkmale eng mit Habitusmerkmalen (Milieu und Gesellungsstil) verbunden sind. Die theoretische Verknüpfung von Habitus/ Feldtheorie und der Netzwerkanalyse und deren empirische Validierung liefert uns einerseits ein theoretisches Fundament für die Netzwerkforschung, andererseits eine Grundlage zur weiteren empirischen Erforschung des wechselseitigen Zusammenhanges von Makro- und Mikroebene bzw.

Over 1946–2009, countries with public debt/GDP ratios above 90% averaged 2.2% real annual GDP growth, not −0.1% as published. The published results for (i) median GDP growth rates for the 1946–2009 period and (ii) mean and median GDP growth figures over 1790–2009 are all distorted by similar methodological errors, although the magnitudes of the distortions are somewhat smaller than with the mean figures for 1946–2009. Contrary to Reinhart and Rogoff’s broader contentions, both mean and median GDP growth when public debt levels exceed 90% of GDP are not dramatically different from when the public debt/GDP ratios are lower. The relationship between public debt and GDP growth varies significantly by period and country.

In the 1970s, psychologists began conducting new kinds of experiments, the results of which seemed to falsify the assumption of rational individual behavior. This compelled experimental economists to stake out a position for the economics discipline regarding the results. Much to their surprise, their experiments corroborated the results of the psychologists. This led them to completely discard preference theory but at the same time to emphasize the role of the market as the mechanism that rationalizes individual behavior. An initially diverse and unorganized group of financial and other economists drew very different conclusions from these same experimental results. They saw them as proof of observed anomalies in financial markets and hailed Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's prospect theory as the most important candidate for replacing the traditional microeconomic model of human behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Heukelom","given":"Floris"}],"citation-key":"heukelomWhatConcludePsychological2011","container-title":"History of Political Economy","container-title-short":"History of Political Economy","DOI":"10.1215/00182702-1430274","ISSN":"0018-2702, 1527-1919","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,12,21]]},"language":"en","page":"649-681","source":"hope.dukejournals.org","title":"What to Conclude from Psychological Experiments: The Contrasting Cases of Experimental and Behavioral Economics","title-short":"What to Conclude from Psychological Experiments","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://hope.dukejournals.org/content/43/4/649","volume":"43"},

This article offers an overview of machine learning methods well-suited to social science problems, including decision trees, dimension reduction methods, nearest neighbor algorithms, support vector models, and penalized regression. In addition to novel algorithms, machine learning places great emphasis on model checking (through holdout samples and cross-validation) and model shrinkage (adjusting predictions toward the mean to reduce overfitting). This article advocates replacing typical regression analyses with two different sorts of models used in concert. A multi-algorithm ensemble approach should be used to determine the noise floor of a given dataset, while simpler methods such as penalized regression or decision trees should be used for theory building and hypothesis testing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Hindman","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"hindmanBuildingBetterModels2015","container-title":"The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science","container-title-short":"The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science","DOI":"10.1177/0002716215570279","ISSN":"0002-7162","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"48-62","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Building Better Models: Prediction, Replication, and Machine Learning in the Social Sciences","title-short":"Building Better Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0002716215570279","volume":"659"},
  {"id":"hirsch-hoeflerTwoKindVoting2010","abstract":"Over the last two decades a number of theoretical perspectives have emphasized the growing phenomenon of extremist political challenges. These challenges come from two main sources: largely secular radical right-wing populism and religious fundamentalism. Yet the relationship between the two is still theoretically and empirically limited. Researchers have usually limited their discussion to only one of the phenomena, ignoring the fact that despite the basic distinction between the two (i.e., secular versus religious orientation), the literature points to many commonalities. This article takes up the challenge by analyzing the predictive power of socioeconomic, ideological, and security threat factors on voting behavior for populist radical right (PRR) parties and for religious fundamentalist (RF) parties. Data collected following the Israeli parliamentary election of 2003 (N = 808) offer a challenge to the conventional, secular wisdom of right-wing extremism. The radical right party family is multifaceted with at least two flanks – a hawkish nationalist flank on the one hand, and a ‘faith-based’ radical flank on the other. Implications of these distinctions for voting behavior scholars and radical right-wing scholars are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hirsch-Hoefler","given":"Sivan"},{"family":"Canetti","given":"Daphna"},{"family":"Pedahzur","given":"Ami"}],"citation-key":"hirsch-hoeflerTwoKindVoting2010","collection-title":"Special Symposium: The 2008 U.S. Presidential Election","container-title":"Electoral Studies","container-title-short":"Electoral Studies","DOI":"10.1016/j.electstud.2010.07.003","ISSN":"0261-3794","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"678-690","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Two of a kind?

  {"id":"hirschmanRediscoveringKnowledgeInfrastructures2021","abstract":"In the 2000s, newly analyzed tax data revealed that top incomes in the United States—summarized as the 1%—had been rising dramatically upward since the early 1980s. Why did it take social scientists two decades to identify this trend and to incorporate it into debates about contemporary income inequality? Drawing on insights from the history and sociology of science, I argue that the social sciences rely on knowledge infrastructures to monitor trends and identify stylized facts. These infrastructures collect, process, and distribute data in ways that channel sustained attention to particular problems while rendering other potential observations out of focus. Like other infrastructures, they have significant inertia: initial design choices become locked in and shape the kinds of data readily available to future researchers. Thus economic knowledge infrastructures constructed in the mid-20th century, while identifying some forms of increasing income inequality, were incapable of tracking top incomes, which created the conditions for missing the rise of the 1%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Hirschman","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"hirschmanRediscoveringKnowledgeInfrastructures2021","container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1086/718451","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,1]]},"page":"739-786","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Rediscovering the 1%: Knowledge Infrastructures and the Stylized Facts of Inequality","title-short":"Rediscovering the 1%","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/718451","volume":"127"},

Does this crisis create favourable conditions for the reform and revitalisation of economics itself--from a subject dominated by mathematical techniques to a discipline more oriented to understanding real-world institutions and actors?

Recent shortcomings are partly related to the global triumph of market individualist ideology and partly to the exaggerated roles of modelling and quantification.

Some have raised concerns that the FPs compromise the cohesion policies of the European Commission aimed at reducing income disparities between European regions. We investigate whether existing scientific collaborations between European Union (EU) subnational regions—as captured by co-authored publications—are conducive for acquiring FP funding, and whether FP funding, in turn, stimulates subsequent co-publication activity between pairs of EU regions. Our results indicate that previous co-publication activity only has a minor effect on being funded. We also find that the effect of funding on co-publication activity is especially significant for regional pairs that did not intensively co-publish before participation. The results suggest that the returns to FP funding are highest when involving scientifically lagging regions. In this respect, the current FP policy is in line with cohesion policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoekman","given":"Jarno"},{"family":"Scherngell","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Frenken","given":"Koen"},{"family":"Tijssen","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"hoekmanAcquisitionEuropeanResearch2013","container-title":"Journal of Economic Geography","container-title-short":"J Econ Geogr","DOI":"10.1093/jeg/lbs011","ISSN":"1468-2702, 1468-2710","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"23-52","source":"joeg.oxfordjournals.org","title":"Acquisition of European research funds and its effect on international scientific collaboration","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://joeg.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/1/23","volume":"13"},

Does the diversity paradox hold for scientists as well? We study this by utilizing a near-complete population of ∼1.2 million US doctoral recipients from 1977 to 2015 and following their careers into publishing and faculty positions. We use text analysis and machine learning to answer a series of questions: How do we detect scientific innovations? Are underrepresented groups more likely to generate scientific innovations? And are the innovations of underrepresented groups adopted and rewarded? Our analyses show that underrepresented groups produce higher rates of scientific novelty. However, their novel contributions are devalued and discounted: For example, novel contributions by gender and racial minorities are taken up by other scholars at lower rates than novel contributions by gender and racial majorities, and equally impactful contributions of gender and racial minorities are less likely to result in successful scientific careers than for majority groups. These results suggest there may be unwarranted reproduction of stratification in academic careers that discounts diversity’s role in innovation and partly explains the underrepresentation of some groups in academia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Hofstra","given":"Bas"},{"family":"Kulkarni","given":"Vivek V."},{"family":"Galvez","given":"Sebastian Munoz-Najar"},{"family":"He","given":"Bryan"},{"family":"Jurafsky","given":"Dan"},{"family":"McFarland","given":"Daniel A."}],"citation-key":"hofstraDiversityInnovationParadox2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1915378117","ISBN":"9781915378118","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,28]]},"language":"en","page":"9284-9291","PMID":"32291335","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Social Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"The Diversity–Innovation Paradox in Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/117/17/9284","volume":"117"},

While the origins and agendas of these groups differ in important ways, all arose in a climate of intensifying globalisation. All arose in the context of a widespread embrace of multiculturalism and cultural diversity. And all are keenly focused on the perceived threats posed by immigration. This paper examines immigration threat narratives constructed by four of these groups: the British National Party, the One Nation Party, the Tea Party Patriots, and the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps. Striking similarities in the narratives employed by these groups suggest the emergence of a transnational right-wing populist ‘playbook’.

The present article proposes that—when the former is measured by industry recognition (Oscars and other awards) and the latter by market performance (box office and video rentals) and when the former hinges on the evaluative judgments of reviewers and consumers (ratings of excellence) and the latter on the level of buzz among these audience members (amount of attention, word of mouth, or click of mouse)—the two phenomena are essentially separable as independent paths to conceptually distinct and empirically uncorrelated aspects of motion-picture success. An analysis of data for 190 movies from the year 2003 shows that reviewer-and-consumer evaluations and buzz respond differently to a film’s marketing clout (production budget, opening screens, and opening box office) and that these audience responses contribute independently to a film’s industry recognition and market performance along two separable paths.

  {"id":"hollisterEmploymentStabilityLabor2011","abstract":"Most Americans believe that employment stability has declined in recent decades. Initial efforts to document this trend empirically, however, produced mixed results, and so research lost momentum. This review shows that evidence of declines in employment stability is stronger than originally portrayed and that therefore the field deserves renewed attention, particularly in light of the current recession. Research shows consistent declines in employment stability among private-sector male workers but more complex trends for female and public-sector workers. Future research should not only seek to better document these trends but go further by investigating their possible causes and broader consequences. Additionally, although changes have occurred, they do not match the strength of public perceptions. Further work is necessary, therefore, to understand this contradiction and the changing role of employment in American society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Hollister","given":"Matissa"}],"citation-key":"hollisterEmploymentStabilityLabor2011","container-title":"Annual Review of Sociology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-soc-081309-150042","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-081309-150042","page":"305-324","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Employment Stability in the U.S. Labor Market: Rhetoric versus Reality","title-short":"Employment Stability in the U.S. Labor Market","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-081309-150042","volume":"37"},

Quantifying the gender gap may identify fields that will not reach parity without intervention, reveal underappreciated biases, and inform benchmarks for gender balance among conference speakers, editors, and hiring committees. Using the PubMed and arXiv databases, we estimated the gender of 36 million authors from >100 countries publishing in >6000 journals, covering most STEMM disciplines over the last 15 years, and made a web app allowing easy access to the data (https://lukeholman.github.io/genderGap/). Despite recent progress, the gender gap appears likely to persist for generations, particularly in surgery, computer science, physics, and maths. The gap is especially large in authorship positions associated with seniority, and prestigious journals have fewer women authors. Additionally, we estimate that men are invited by journals to submit papers at approximately double the rate of women. Wealthy countries, notably Japan, Germany, and Switzerland, had fewer women authors than poorer ones.

  {"id":"holmwoodSociologyMisfortuneDisciplines2010","abstract":"This paper is about tendencies to the subversion of sociology as a discipline. It connects external factors of the wider socio-political environment of higher education in the UK, especially those associated with the audit culture and new systems of governance, with the internal organization of the discipline. While the environment is similar for all social science subjects, the paper argues that there are specific consequences for sociology because of characteristics peculiar to the discipline. The paper discusses these consequences in terms of the changing relationship between sociology and the growing interdisciplinary area of applied social studies as a form of ‘mode 2 knowledge’. It argues that while sociology ‘exports’ concepts, methodologies and personnel it lacks the internal disciplinary integrity of other ‘exporter’ disciplines, such as economics, political science and anthropology. The consequence is an increasingly blurred distinction between sociology as a discipline and the interdisciplinary area of applied social studies with a potential loss of disciplinary identity. The paper concludes with a discussion of how this loss of identity is associated with a reduced ability to reproduce a critical sensibility within sociology and absorption to the constraints of audit culture with its preferred form of mode 2 knowledge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Holmwood","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"holmwoodSociologyMisfortuneDisciplines2010","container-title":"The British Journal of Sociology","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2010.01332.x","ISSN":"1468-4446","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2010.01332.x","page":"639-658","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Sociology's misfortune: disciplines, interdisciplinarity and the impact of audit culture","title-short":"Sociology's misfortune","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2010.01332.x","volume":"61"},

The 1930s were a time of high hopes, empirically (field studies, new statistical techniques) and theoretically (for instance, functionalism and operationalism). The great achievement of sociology has been its development of statistical techniques, but these have had the effect of inhibiting field studies. In theory, sociology has remained divided into a number of different schools, a condition maintained by the failure of most sociologists to consider what a theory is. The condition can be overcome only by sociologists’ accepting the “covering law” view of theory, the covering laws referring to the behavior of individual persons as members of a single species, and the laws themselves being the laws of behavioral psychology. Recent favorable developments in sociology include network analysis, historical sociology, and sociobiology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Homans","given":"George C."}],"citation-key":"homansFiftyYearsSociology1986","container-title":"Annual Review of Sociology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.so.12.080186.005033","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1986]]},"page":"xiii-xxx","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Fifty Years of Sociology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.so.12.080186.005033","volume":"12"},

Homans concentrates on certain activities and processes he observes in five carefully selected and differentiated case studies and from them draws common patterns and ideas that serve as the bases of testable propositions.  He divides his cases into static and dynamic groups. In all five cases, Homans selects comparable phenomena for analysis with a contextually different emphasis and elaboration each time. His results demonstrate that, different as these groups are, their behavior reveals fundamental similarities and social uniformities.

This paper uses network visualization techniques and qualitative-historical analysis to discuss the structure, origins and development of this network and to analyse the reasons for its recent erosion. Network visualization makes it possible to identify crucial entanglement patterns that can be traced back historically. In three phases of network formation – the 1880s, 1920s and the 1950s – capital entanglement resulted from the interaction of company behaviour and government policy. In its heyday, the company network was de facto encompassing and provided its core participants, especially the banks, with a national, macroeconomic perspective. In the 1970s, increased competition among financial companies set in. In the 1980s and 1990s, declining returns from blockholding and increased opportunity costs made network dissolution a thinkable option for companies. Because of the strategic reorientation of the largest banks toward investment banking, ties between banks and industry underwent functional changes. Since the year 2000, the German government's tax policy has sped up network erosion. Vanishing capital ties imply a declining degree of strategic co-ordination among large German companies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Höpner","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Krempel","given":"Lothar"}],"citation-key":"hopnerPoliticsGermanCompany2004","container-title":"Competition and Change","DOI":"10.1080/1024259042000304392","ISSN":"1024-5294","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,12,1]]},"page":"339-356","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The politics of the German company network","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1024259042000304392","volume":"8"},

To identify underlying causes of this funding gap, we analyzed six stages of the application process from 2011 to 2015 and found that disparate outcomes arise at three of the six: decision to discuss, impact score assignment, and a previously unstudied stage, topic choice. Notably, AA/B applicants tend to propose research on topics with lower award rates. These topics include research at the community and population level, as opposed to more fundamental and mechanistic investigations; the latter tend to have higher award rates.

  {"id":"hosmerComparisonGoodnessofFitTests1997","abstract":"Recent work has shown that there may be disadvantages in the use of the chi-square-like goodness-of-fit tests for the logistic regression model proposed by Hosmer and Lemeshow that use fixed groups of the estimated probabilities. A particular concern with these grouping strategies based on estimated probabilities, fitted values, is that groups may contain subjects with widely different values of the covariates. It is possible to demonstrate situations where one set of fixed groups shows the model fits while the test rejects fit using a different set of fixed groups. We compare the performance by simulation of these tests to tests based on smoothed residuals proposed by le Cessie and Van Houwelingen and Royston, a score test for an extended logistic regression model proposed by Stukel, the Pearson chi-square and the unweighted residual sum-of- squares. These simulations demonstrate that all but one of Royston's tests have the correct size. An examination of the performance of the tests when the correct model has a quadratic term but a model containing only the linear term has been fit shows that the Pearson chi-square, the unweighted sum-of-squares, the Hosmer–Lemeshow decile of risk, the smoothed residual sum-of-squares and Stukel's score test, have power exceeding 50 per cent to detect moderate departures from linearity when the sample size is 100 and have power over 90 per cent for these same alternatives for samples of size 500. All tests had no power when the correct model had an interaction between a dichotomous and continuous covariate but only the continuous covariate model was fit. Power to detect an incorrectly specified link was poor for samples of size 100. For samples of size 500 Stukel's score test had the best power but it only exceeded 50 per cent to detect an asymmetric link function. The power of the unweighted sum-of-squares test to detect an incorrectly specified link function was slightly less than Stukel's score test.

  {"id":"huangHistoricalComparisonGender2020","abstract":"There is extensive, yet fragmented, evidence of gender differences in academia suggesting that women are underrepresented in most scientific disciplines and publish fewer articles throughout a career, and their work acquires fewer citations. Here, we offer a comprehensive picture of longitudinal gender differences in performance through a bibliometric analysis of academic publishing careers by reconstructing the complete publication history of over 1.5 million gender-identified authors whose publishing career ended between 1955 and 2010, covering 83 countries and 13 disciplines. We find that, paradoxically, the increase of participation of women in science over the past 60 years was accompanied by an increase of gender differences in both productivity and impact. Most surprisingly, though, we uncover two gender invariants, finding that men and women publish at a comparable annual rate and have equivalent career-wise impact for the same size body of work. Finally, we demonstrate that differences in publishing career lengths and dropout rates explain a large portion of the reported career-wise differences in productivity and impact, although productivity differences still remain. This comprehensive picture of gender inequality in academia can help rephrase the conversation around the sustainability of women’s careers in academia, with important consequences for institutions and policy makers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Junming"},{"family":"Gates","given":"Alexander J."},{"family":"Sinatra","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Barabási","given":"Albert-László"}],"citation-key":"huangHistoricalComparisonGender2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1914221117","ISBN":"9781914221118","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,3]]},"language":"en","page":"4609-4616","PMID":"32071248","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Social Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Historical comparison of gender inequality in scientific careers across countries and disciplines","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/117/9/4609","volume":"117"},

Developed by private building-owners, the network evolved from tree-like to grid-like over the course of 50 years. We find that decentralized forces with the goal of maximizing individual buildings’ profitability shaped the network. Our analysis shows that a building with greater office size, a sign of greater accessibility, was more likely to be connected earlier. The distribution of existing skyway segments is found to follow a power-law function of the average degree, closeness, and eigenvector centralities of the vertices. We further explain and model the evolutionary process using an agent-based model.

  {"id":"hyonSimilarityFunctionalBrain2020","abstract":"People often have the intuition that they are similar to their friends, yet evidence for homophily (being friends with similar others) based on self-reported personality is inconsistent. Functional connectomes—patterns of spontaneous synchronization across the brain—are stable within individuals and predict how people tend to think and behave. Thus, they may capture interindividual variability in latent traits that are particularly similar among friends but that might elude self-report. Here, we examined interpersonal similarity in functional connectivity at rest—that is, in the absence of external stimuli—and tested if functional connectome similarity is associated with proximity in a real-world social network. The social network of a remote village was reconstructed; a subset of residents underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Similarity in functional connectomes was positively related to social network proximity, particularly in the default mode network. Controlling for similarities in demographic and personality data (the Big Five personality traits) yielded similar results. Thus, functional connectomes may capture latent interpersonal similarities between friends that are not fully captured by commonly used demographic or personality measures. The localization of these results suggests how friends may be particularly similar to one another. Additionally, geographic proximity moderated the relationship between neural similarity and social network proximity, suggesting that such associations are particularly strong among people who live particularly close to one another. These findings suggest that social connectivity is reflected in signatures of brain functional connectivity, consistent with the common intuition that friends share similarities that go beyond, for example, demographic similarities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Hyon","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Youm","given":"Yoosik"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Junsol"},{"family":"Chey","given":"Jeanyung"},{"family":"Kwak","given":"Seyul"},{"family":"Parkinson","given":"Carolyn"}],"citation-key":"hyonSimilarityFunctionalBrain2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2013606117","ISBN":"9782013606110","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,14]]},"language":"en","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Social Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Similarity in functional brain connectivity at rest predicts interpersonal closeness in the social network of an entire village","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/12/11/2013606117"},

  {"id":"inglehartModernizationPostmodernizationCultural1997","abstract":"Ronald Inglehart argues that economic development, cultural change, and political change go together in coherent and even, to some extent, predictable patterns. This is a controversial claim. It implies that some trajectories of socioeconomic change are more likely than others--and consequently that certain changes are foreseeable. Once a society has embarked on industrialization, for example, a whole syndrome of related changes, from mass mobilization to diminishing differences in gender roles, is likely to appear. These changes in worldviews seem to reflect changes in the economic and political environment, but they take place with a generational time lag and have considerable autonomy and momentum of their own. But industrialization is not the end of history. Advanced industrial society leads to a basic shift in values, de-emphasizing the instrumental rationality that characterized industrial society. Postmodern values then bring new societal changes, including democratic political institutions and the decline of state socialist regimes. To demonstrate the powerful links between belief systems and political and socioeconomic variables, this book draws on a unique database, the World Values Surveys. This database covers a broader range than ever before available for looking at the impact of mass publics on political and social life. It provides information from societies representing 70 percent of the world's population--from societies with per capita incomes as low as $300 per year to those with per capita incomes one hundred times greater and from long-established democracies with market economies to authoritarian states.","author":[{"family":"Inglehart","given":"Ronald"}],"citation-key":"inglehartModernizationPostmodernizationCultural1997","ISBN":"0-691-01180-X","issued":{"date-parts":[[1997]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"468","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Modernization and Postmodernization: Cultural, Economic, and Political Change in 43 Societies","title-short":"Modernization and Postmodernization","type":"book"},

Therefore, understanding and managing complexity in supply chains are very popular topics nowadays. Measures for complexity in supply chains contribute to their manageability and controllability. This paper describes an approach to the measurement of complexity in supply chains based on Shannon's information entropy. The new proposed approach gives a formal approach that is able to measure and analyse the supply chain complexity. The main contribution of this study is to extend two formulas (structural and operational complexity) building on Shannon's entropy measure to evaluate the complexity of a supply chain.

  {"id":"ivanovImpactStockMarket2014","abstract":"We analyse times between consecutive transactions for a diverse group of stocks registered on the NYSE and NASDAQ markets, and we relate the dynamical properties of the intertrade times with those of the corresponding price fluctuations. We report that market structure strongly impacts the scale-invariant temporal organisation in the transaction timing of stocks, which we have observed to have long-range power-law correlations. Specifically, we find that, compared to NYSE stocks, stocks registered on the NASDAQ exhibit significantly stronger correlations in their transaction timing on scales within a trading day. Further, we find that companies that transfer from the NASDAQ to the NYSE show a reduction in the correlation strength of transaction timing on scales within a trading day, indicating influences of market structure. We also report a persistent decrease in correlation strength of intertrade times with increasing average intertrade time and with corresponding decrease in companies' market capitalization–a trend which is less pronounced for NASDAQ stocks. Surprisingly, we observe that stronger power-law correlations in intertrade times are coupled with stronger power-law correlations in absolute price returns and higher price volatility, suggesting a strong link between the dynamical properties of intertrade times and the corresponding price fluctuations over a broad range of time scales. Comparing the NYSE and NASDAQ markets, we demonstrate that the stronger correlations we find in intertrade times for NASDAQ stocks are associated with stronger correlations in absolute price returns and with higher volatility, suggesting that market structure may affect price behavior through information contained in transaction timing. These findings do not support the hypothesis of universal scaling behavior in stock dynamics that is independent of company characteristics and stock market structure. Further, our results have implications for utilising transaction timing patterns in price prediction and risk management optimization on different stock markets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Ivanov","given":"Plamen Ch."},{"family":"Yuen","given":"Ainslie"},{"family":"Perakakis","given":"Pandelis"}],"citation-key":"ivanovImpactStockMarket2014","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0092885","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,3]]},"page":"e92885","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Impact of Stock Market Structure on Intertrade Time and Price Dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0092885","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"jacksonCenturyEducationalInequality2020","abstract":"The “income inequality hypothesis” holds that rising income inequality affects the distribution of a wide range of social and economic outcomes. Although it is often alleged that rising income inequality will increase the advantages of the well-off in the competition for college, some researchers have provided descriptive evidence at odds with the income inequality hypothesis. In this paper, we track long-term trends in family income inequalities in college enrollment and completion (“collegiate inequalities”) using all available nationally representative datasets for cohorts born between 1908 and 1995. We show that the trends in collegiate inequalities moved in lockstep with the trend in income inequality over the past century. There is one exception to this general finding: For cohorts at risk for serving in the Vietnam War, collegiate inequalities were high, while income inequality was low. During this period, inequality in college enrollment and completion was significantly higher for men than for women, suggesting a bona fide “Vietnam War” effect. Aside from this singular confounding event, a century of evidence establishes a strong association between income and collegiate inequality, providing support for the view that rising income inequality is fundamentally changing the distribution of life chances.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Jackson","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Holzman","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"jacksonCenturyEducationalInequality2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1907258117","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,22]]},"language":"en","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Social Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"A century of educational inequality in the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/07/21/1907258117"},

  {"id":"jacobsCulturalSociologyCrossroads2005","abstract":"This article examines two questions. First, what difference does it make when approaches developed in cultural sociology are applied more broadly? We suggest here that such applications subject theoretical assumptions in other sub-fields to investigation, challenge, and development by providing the conceptual resources for empirically linking micro- and macro-analysis: cultural processes, shaping the possibilities and limits of meaning-making, are understood as the practical intersection of structure and agency, the switchpoint between them. Conversely, what do such applications then imply for the further development of cultural sociology? Four issues are highlighted. Empirically, they suggest that cultural sociologists should remedy their under-emphasis of transnational processes, and also that the influence of specialized cultural institutions like art on broader culture processes should be reconsidered. Theoretically, they encourage a renewed emphasis on understanding the causal significance of culture. Finally, the articles here suggest that the proliferation of theoretical concepts in cultural sociology creates a productive ambiguity encouraging the development and diffusion of the field, but also calls for better articulation of the pertinence of divergent analytic tools to particular research problems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Mark D."},{"family":"Spillman","given":"Lyn"}],"citation-key":"jacobsCulturalSociologyCrossroads2005","collection-title":"Cultural sociology and sociological publics","container-title":"Poetics","container-title-short":"Poetics","DOI":"10.1016/j.poetic.2005.01.001","ISSN":"0304-422X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,2,1]]},"page":"1-14","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Cultural sociology at the crossroads of the discipline","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X05000045","volume":"33"},
  {"id":"jacobsDefenseDisciplinesInterdisciplinarity2014","abstract":"Calls for closer connections among disciplines can be heard throughout the world of scholarly research, from major universities to the National Institutes of Health. In Defense of Disciplines presents a fresh and daring analysis of the argument surrounding interdisciplinarity. Challenging the belief that blurring the boundaries between traditional academic fields promotes more integrated research and effective teaching, Jerry Jacobs contends that the promise of interdisciplinarity is illusory and that critiques of established disciplines are often overstated and misplaced.  Drawing on diverse sources of data, Jacobs offers a new theory of liberal arts disciplines such as biology, economics, and history that identifies the organizational sources of their dynamism and breadth. Illustrating his thesis with a wide range of case studies including the diffusion of ideas between fields, the creation of interdisciplinary scholarly journals, and the rise of new fields that spin off from existing ones, Jacobs turns many of the criticisms of disciplines on their heads to mount a powerful defense of the enduring value of liberal arts disciplines. This will become one of the anchors of the case against interdisciplinarity for years to come.","author":[{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Jerry A."}],"citation-key":"jacobsDefenseDisciplinesInterdisciplinarity2014","ISBN":"978-0-226-06946-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,2,5]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"284","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"Google Books","title":"In Defense of Disciplines: Interdisciplinarity and Specialization in the Research University","title-short":"In Defense of Disciplines","type":"book"},

  {"id":"jacobsJournalRankingsSociology2016","abstract":"There is considerable interest in the ranking of journals, given the intense pressure to place articles in the “top” journals. In this article, a new index, h, and a new source of data—Google Scholar – are introduced, and a number of advantages of this methodology to assessing journals are noted. This approach is attractive because it provides a more robust account of the scholarly enterprise than do the standard Journal Citation Reports. Readily available software enables do-it-yourself assessments of journals, including those not otherwise covered, and enable the journal selection process to become a research endeavor that identifies particular articles of interest. While some critics are skeptical about the visibility and impact of sociological research, the evidence presented here indicates that most sociology journals produce a steady stream of papers that garner considerable attention. While the position of individual journals varies across measures, there is a high degree commonality across these measurement approaches. A clear hierarchy of journals remains no matter what assessment metric is used. Moreover, data over time indicate that the hierarchy of journals is highly stable and self-perpetuating. Yet highly visible articles do appear in journals outside the set of elite journals. In short, the h index provides a more comprehensive picture of the output and noteworthy consequences of sociology journals than do than standard impact scores, even though the overall ranking of journals does not markedly change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Jerry A."}],"citation-key":"jacobsJournalRankingsSociology2016","container-title":"The American Sociologist","container-title-short":"Am Soc","DOI":"10.1007/s12108-015-9292-7","ISSN":"0003-1232, 1936-4784","issue":"2-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"192-224","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Journal Rankings in Sociology: Using the H Index with Google Scholar","title-short":"Journal Rankings in Sociology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12108-015-9292-7","volume":"47"},

Recent studies show that gender inequality is still present in many scientific practices ranging from hiring to peer-review processes and grant applications. In this work, we investigate gender-specific differences in collaboration patterns of more than one million computer scientists over the course of 47 years. We explore how these patterns change over years and career ages and how they impact scientific success. Our results highlight that successful male and female scientists reveal the same collaboration patterns: compared to scientists in the same career age, they tend to collaborate with more colleagues than other scientists, seek innovations as brokers and establish longer-lasting and more repetitive collaborations. However, women are on average less likely to adopt the collaboration patterns that are related with success, more likely to embed into ego networks devoid of structural holes, and they exhibit stronger gender homophily as well as a consistently higher dropout rate than men in all career ages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Jadidi","given":"Mohsen"},{"family":"Karimi","given":"Fariba"},{"family":"Lietz","given":"Haiko"},{"family":"Wagner","given":"Claudia"}],"citation-key":"jadidiGenderDisparitiesScience2017","container-title":"Advances in Complex Systems","container-title-short":"Advs. Complex Syst.","DOI":"10.1142/S0219525917500114","ISSN":"0219-5259","issue":"03n04","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,1]]},"page":"1750011","publisher":"World Scientific Publishing Co.","source":"worldscientific.com (Atypon)","title":"Gender disparities in science? dropout, productivity, collaborations and success of male and female computer scientists","title-short":"Gender disparities in science?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219525917500114","volume":"21"},

This tension may be better understood by examining how management practices are used to put strategy into practice. Such practices span multiple levels of context and are adaptable to their circumstances of use, serving to highlight both general characteristics and localized idiosyncrasies of strategy as practice.

In particular, we consider the importance of initial public offerings (IPOs), gross domestic product (GDP) and market capitalization growth, labor market rigidities, accounting standards, private pension funds, and government programs. We find that IPOs are the strongest driver of venture capital investing. Private pension fund levels are a significant determinant over time but not across countries. Surprisingly, GDP and market capitalization growth are not significant. Government policies can have a strong impact, both by setting the regulatory stage, and by galvanizing investment during downturns. Finally, we also show that different types of venture capital financing are affected differently by these factors. In particular, early stage venture capital investing is negatively impacted by labor market rigidities, while later stage is not. IPOs have no effect on early stage venture capital investing across countries, but are a significant determinant of later stage venture capital investing across countries. Finally, government funded venture capital has different sensitivities to the determinants of venture capital than non-government funded venture capital. Our insights emphasize the need for a more differentiated approach to venture capital, both from a research as well as from a policy perspective. We feel that while later stage venture capital investing is well understood, early stage and government funded investments still require more extensive research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Jeng","given":"Leslie A."},{"family":"Wells","given":"Philippe C."}],"citation-key":"jengDeterminantsVentureCapital2000","container-title":"Journal of Corporate Finance","container-title-short":"Journal of Corporate Finance","DOI":"10.1016/S0929-1199(00)00003-1","ISSN":"0929-1199","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,9,1]]},"page":"241-289","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The determinants of venture capital funding: evidence across countries","title-short":"The determinants of venture capital funding","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929119900000031","volume":"6"},

The training dataset of such tasks often contain information of content, links and labels, while the testing dataset have only content and link information. Conventional collective prediction algorithms conduct predictions based on the content of a node and the information of its direct neighbors with a base classifier. However, the information of some direct neighbor nodes may be not consistent with the target one. In addition, the information of indirect neighbors can be helpful when that of direct neighbors is scant. In this paper, instead of using information of direct neighbors, we propose to apply community structures in networks to prediction tasks. A community detection method is aggregated into the collective prediction process to improve prediction performance. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms a number of standard prediction algorithms specially under conditions that labeled training dataset are limited.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"Yasong"},{"family":"Li","given":"Taisong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Yonghong"}],"citation-key":"jiangCollectivePredictionBased2016","container-title":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","container-title-short":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","DOI":"10.1016/j.physa.2016.08.055","ISSN":"0378-4371","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Collective prediction based on community structure","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437116305726","volume":"in press"},

By examining 4.2 million papers published over three decades, we found that multi-university collaborations (i) are the fastest growing type of authorship structure, (ii) produce the highest-impact papers when they include a top-tier university, and (iii) are increasingly stratified by in-group university rank. Despite the rising frequency of research that crosses university boundaries, the intensification of social stratification in multi-university collaborations suggests a concentration of the production of scientific knowledge in fewer rather than more centers of high-impact science.\nOver the past 30 years, scientific papers have become increasingly likely to be written by teams of authors from more than one of a small number of elite universities.\nOver the past 30 years, scientific papers have become increasingly likely to be written by teams of authors from more than one of a small number of elite universities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"Benjamin F."},{"family":"Wuchty","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Uzzi","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"jonesMultiUniversityResearchTeams2008","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.1158357","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"5905","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,11,21]]},"language":"en","page":"1259-1262","PMID":"18845711","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"Multi-University Research Teams: Shifting Impact, Geography, and Stratification in Science","title-short":"Multi-University Research Teams","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/322/5905/1259","volume":"322"},

They serve as network-proxies for measuring the robustness of the global financial system and the interdependence of financial markets, respectively. Two early-warning indicators for financial crises are identified: First, the algebraic connectivity of the equity securities network, as a measure for structural robustness, drops close to zero already in 2005, while there is an over-representation of high-degree off-shore financial centres among the countries most-related to this observation, suggesting an investigation of such nodes with respect to the structural stability of the global financial system. Second, using a phenomenological model, the edge density of the debt securities network is found to describe, and even forecast, the proliferation of several over-the-counter-traded financial derivatives, most prominently credit default swaps, enabling one to detect potentially dangerous levels of market interdependence and systemic risk.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Joseph","given":"Andreas C."},{"family":"Joseph","given":"Stephan E."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Guanrong"}],"citation-key":"josephCrossborderPortfolioInvestment2014","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/srep03991","ISSN":"2045-2322","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,2,10]]},"PMCID":"PMC3918927","PMID":"24510060","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Cross-border Portfolio Investment Networks and Indicators for Financial Crises","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3918927/","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"kaffaiModelingNonpharmaceuticalInterventions2021","abstract":"Governments around the globe use non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to curb the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Making decisions under uncertainty, they all face the same temporal paradox: estimating the impact of NPIs before they have been implemented. Due to the limited variance of empirical cases, researchers could so far not disentangle effects of individual NPIs or their impact on different demographic groups. In this paper, we utilize large-scale agent-based simulations in combination with Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) models to investigate the spread of COVID-19 for some of the most affected federal states in Germany. In contrast to other studies, we sample agents from a representative survey. Including more realistic demographic attributes that influence agents’ behavior yields accurate predictions of COVID-19 transmissions and allows us to investigate counterfactual what-if scenarios. Results show that quarantining infected people and exploiting industry-specific home office capacities are the most effective NPIs. Disentangling education-related NPIs reveals that each considered institution (kindergarten, school, university) has rather small effects on its own, yet, that combined openings would result in large increases in COVID-19 cases. Representative survey-characteristics of agents also allow us to estimate NPIs’ effects on different age groups. For instance, re-opening schools would cause comparatively few infections among the risk-group of people older than 60 years.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Kaffai","given":"Marius"},{"family":"Heiberger","given":"Raphael H."}],"citation-key":"kaffaiModelingNonpharmaceuticalInterventions2021","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0259108","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,28]]},"language":"en","page":"e0259108","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Modeling non-pharmaceutical interventions in the COVID-19 pandemic with survey-based simulations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0259108","volume":"16"},

Firms announce repurchases when executives have large numbers of options outstanding and when employees have large numbers of options currently exercisable. Once the decision to repurchase is made, the amount repurchased is positively related to total options exercisable by all employees but independent of managerial options. These results are consistent with managers repurchasing both to maximize their own wealth and to fund employee stock option exercises.

All four types become manifest in a multiplicity of rationalization processes orchestrated at all levels of societal and civilization process.

Results from a three-wave field investigation of newcomer proactive behavior show that newcomer perceptions of surface-level similarity to the rest of the work group in education and gender increased proactive adjustment behavior. Contrary to our expectations, perceived similarity in terms of age decreased proactive adjustment behavior—in other words, newcomers who were significantly different from their co-workers in age engaged in more proactive adjustment behaviors. Deep-level similarity in terms of work style was associated with higher levels of role clarity, but this relationship was not mediated by proactive adjustment behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kammeyer-Mueller","given":"John D."},{"family":"Livingston","given":"Beth A."},{"family":"Liao","given":"Hui"}],"citation-key":"kammeyer-muellerPerceivedSimilarityProactive2011","container-title":"Journal of Vocational Behavior","container-title-short":"Journal of Vocational Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.jvb.2010.09.012","ISSN":"0001-8791","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"225-236","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Perceived similarity, proactive adjustment, and organizational socialization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879110001612","volume":"78"},

There is a rich literature stressing peculiarities of individual country experiences, but little systematic comparison across EMEs. This paper fills this gap, providing an overview of the debate and identifying six financialisation interpretations for EMEs. These different interpretations stress (1) financial deregulation, (2) foreign financial inflows, (3) asset price volatility, (4) the shift from bank-based to market-based finance, (5) business debt, and (6) household indebtedness. We construct and compare measures of the six financialisation interpretations across a sample of 17 EMEs from Latin America, emerging Europe, Africa and Asia, contrasting them with the US and UK, two financialised economies. We find considerable variation in financialisation experiences of EMEs. Asset price volatility is found across the continents. Asia has been more exposed to capital inflows, stock markets have gained importance and private sector debt has risen. In emerging Europe financial deregulation has been more pronounced with lower levels but strong increases in household debt. The picture is similar in South Africa, the African EME in the sample, where household debt is comparatively high.

Katzenstein and\nRobert O. Keohane have assembled a distinguished group of experts, including historians, polling-data analysts, political scientists, anthropologists, and sociologists, to explore anti-Americanism in depth, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The result is a book that probes deeply a central aspect of world politics\nthat is frequently noted yet rarely understood.\nKatzenstein and Keohane identify several quite different\nanti-Americanisms-liberal, social, sovereign-nationalist, and\nradical.

In this paper, we distinguish between collaboration at different levels and show that inter-institutional and international collaboration need not necessarily involve inter-individual collaboration.

This assumption is predicated on the view that departmental prestige is primarily a function of faculty scholarship. In this article, the association between prestige and scholarship is examined for the discipline of sociology using evaluative ratings from three national studies and objective data on publications. Scholarship is found to be far less important in determining prestige ratings than either the past reputations of departments or their affiliated universities. Publishing is not necessarily a straightforward means of securing a department's prestige. Instead, past reputation reflective of an institutional context, rather than scholarly productivity, appears to be the critical property bearing on how departments are viewed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Keith","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Babchuk","given":"Nicholas"}],"citation-key":"keithQuestInstitutionalRecognition1998","container-title":"Social Forces","DOI":"10.2307/3005843","ISSN":"0037-7732","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998]]},"page":"1495-1533","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Quest for Institutional Recognition: A Longitudinal Analysis of Scholarly Productivity and Academic Prestige among Sociology Departments","title-short":"The Quest for Institutional Recognition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3005843","volume":"76"},

  {"id":"kellySurvivalAnalysisRecurrent2000","abstract":"Many extensions of survival models based on the Cox proportional hazards approach have been proposed to handle clustered or multiple event data. Of particular note are five Cox-based models for recurrent event data: Andersen and Gill (AG); Wei, Lin and Weissfeld (WLW); Prentice, Williams and Peterson, total time (PWP-CP) and gap time (PWP-GT); and Lee, Wei and Amato (LWA). Some authors have compared these models by observing differences that arise from fitting the models to real and simulated data. However, no attempt has been made to systematically identify the components of the models that are appropriate for recurrent event data. We propose a systematic way of characterizing such Cox-based models using four key components: risk intervals; baseline hazard; risk set, and correlation adjustment. From the definitions of risk interval and risk set there are conceptually seven such Cox-based models that are permissible, five of which are those previously identified. The two new variant models are termed the 'total time - restricted' (TT-R) and 'gap time - unrestricted' (GT-UR) models. The aim of the paper is to determine which models are appropriate for recurrent event data using the key components. The models are fitted to simulated data sets and to a data set of childhood recurrent infectious diseases. The LWA model is not appropriate for recurrent event data because it allows a subject to be at risk several times for the same event. The WLW model overestimates treatment effect and is not recommended. We conclude that PWP-GT and TT-R are useful models for analysing recurrent event data, providing answers to slightly different research questions. Further, applying a robust variance to any of these models does not adequately account for within-subject correlation.","author":[{"family":"Kelly","given":"P. J."},{"family":"Lim","given":"L.

  {"id":"kenettFlexibilityThoughtHigh2018","abstract":"Flexibility of thought is theorized to play a critical role in the ability of high creative individuals to generate novel and innovative ideas. However, this has been examined only through indirect behavioral measures. Here we use network percolation analysis (removal of links in a network whose strength is below an increasing threshold) to computationally examine the robustness of the semantic memory networks of low and high creative individuals. Robustness of a network indicates its flexibility and thus can be used to quantify flexibility of thought as related to creativity. This is based on the assumption that the higher the robustness of the semantic network, the higher its flexibility. Our analysis reveals that the semantic network of high creative individuals is more robust to network percolation compared with the network of low creative individuals and that this higher robustness is related to differences in the structure of the networks. Specifically, we find that this higher robustness is related to stronger links connecting between different components of similar semantic words in the network, which may also help to facilitate spread of activation over their network. Thus, we directly and quantitatively examine the relation between flexibility of thought and creative ability. Our findings support the associative theory of creativity, which posits that high creative ability is related to a flexible structure of semantic memory. Finally, this approach may have further implications, by enabling a quantitative examination of flexibility of thought, in both healthy and clinical populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,12,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Kenett","given":"Yoed N."},{"family":"Levy","given":"Orr"},{"family":"Kenett","given":"Dror Y."},{"family":"Stanley","given":"H.

  {"id":"kenterShortTextSimilarity2015","abstract":"Determining semantic similarity between texts is important in many tasks in information retrieval such as search, query suggestion, automatic summarization and image finding. Many approaches have been suggested, based on lexical matching, handcrafted patterns, syntactic parse trees, external sources of structured semantic knowledge and distributional semantics. However, lexical features, like string matching, do not capture semantic similarity beyond a trivial level. Furthermore, handcrafted patterns and external sources of structured semantic knowledge cannot be assumed to be available in all circumstances and for all domains. Lastly, approaches depending on parse trees are restricted to syntactically well-formed texts, typically of one sentence in length. We investigate whether determining short text similarity is possible using only semantic features---where by semantic we mean, pertaining to a representation of meaning---rather than relying on similarity in lexical or syntactic representations. We use word embeddings, vector representations of terms, computed from unlabelled data, that represent terms in a semantic space in which proximity of vectors can be interpreted as semantic similarity. We propose to go from word-level to text-level semantics by combining insights from methods based on external sources of semantic knowledge with word embeddings. A novel feature of our approach is that an arbitrary number of word embedding sets can be incorporated. We derive multiple types of meta-features from the comparison of the word vectors for short text pairs, and from the vector means of their respective word embeddings. The features representing labelled short text pairs are used to train a supervised learning algorithm. We use the trained model at testing time to predict the semantic similarity of new, unlabelled pairs of short texts  We show on a publicly available evaluation set commonly used for the task of semantic similarity that our method outperforms baseline methods that work under the same conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Kenter","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Rijke","given":"Maarten","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"kenterShortTextSimilarity2015","collection-title":"CIKM '15","container-title":"Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","DOI":"10.1145/2806416.2806475","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-3794-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"page":"1411–1420","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Short Text Similarity with Word Embeddings","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2806416.2806475"},

One answer is that women do not believe their work will be published. This article asks whether women systematically study different topics than men and whether these topics may be less likely to appear in top political science journals. To answer this question, we analyzed the content of dissertation abstracts. We found evidence that some topics are indeed gendered. We also found differences in the representation of “women’s” and “men’s” topics in the pages of the top journals.

  {"id":"khailaieEstimateDevelopmentEpidemic2020","abstract":"<p>The novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (CoV) has induced a world-wide pandemic and subsequent non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) in order to control the spreading of the virus. NPIs are considered to be critical in order to at least delay the peak number of infected individuals and to prevent the health care system becoming overwhelmed by the number of patients to treat in hospitals or in intensive care units (ICUs). However, there is also increasing concern that the NPIs in place would increase mortality because of other diseases, increase the frequency of suicide and increase the risk of an economic recession with unforeseeable implications. It is therefore instrumental to evaluate the necessity of NPIs and to monitor the progress of containment of the virus spreading. We used a data-driven estimation of the evolution of the reproduction number for viral spreading in Germany as well as in all its federal states. Based on an extended infection-epidemic model, parameterized with data from the Robert Koch-Institute and, alternatively, with parameters stemming from a fit to the initial phase of CoV spreading in different regions of Italy, we consistently found that the reproduction number was turned down to a range near 1 in all federal states. We used the latest reproduction number as a starting point for the simulation of epidemic progression and varied the reproduction number, mimicking either release or strengthening of NPIs. Germany is currently, April 3rd, 2020, at the border line of a reproduction number between the scenarios of major immunisation of the population or eradication of the virus. We strongly recommend to keep all NPIs in place and suggest to even strengthen the measures in order to accelerate reaching the state of full control, thus, also limiting collateral damage of the NPIs in time.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Khailaie","given":"Sahamoddin"},{"family":"Mitra","given":"Tanmay"},{"family":"Bandyopadhyay","given":"Arnab"},{"family":"Schips","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Mascheroni","given":"Pietro"},{"family":"Vanella","given":"Patrizio"},{"family":"Lange","given":"Berit"},{"family":"Binder","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Meyer-Hermann","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"khailaieEstimateDevelopmentEpidemic2020","container-title":"medRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/2020.04.04.20053637","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,7]]},"language":"en","page":"2020.04.04.20053637","source":"www.medrxiv.org","title":"Estimate of the development of the epidemic reproduction number Rt from Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 case data and implications for political measures based on prognostics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053637v1"},

At the same time, new technologies such as wearable sensors make it possible to collect new types of social network data. We employed RFID tags to capture face-to-face interactions of participants of two consecutive Ph.D. retreats of a graduate school on climate research. We use this data in order to explore how it may support ethnographic observations and to gain further insights on scholarly interactions. The unique feature of the data is the opportunity to distinguish short and long conversations, which often have a different nature from a sociological point of view. Furthermore, an advantage of this data is the availability of socio-demographic, research-related, and situational attributes of participants. We show that, even though an interaction partner is often found rather randomly during coffee breaks of retreats, a strong homophily between participants from the same institutions or research areas exists. We identify cores of the networks and participants who play ambassador roles between communities, e.g., persons who visit the retreat for the second time are more likely to be ambassadors.

  {"id":"kleiberAppliedEconometrics2008","abstract":"This is the first book on applied econometrics using the R system for statistical computing and graphics. It presents hands-on examples for a wide range of econometric models, from classical linear regression models for cross-section, time series or panel data and the common non-linear models of microeconometrics such as logit, probit and tobit models, to recent semiparametric extensions. In addition, it provides a chapter on programming, including simulations, optimization, and an introduction to R tools enabling reproducible econometric research. An R package accompanying this book, AER, is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AER. It contains some 100 data sets taken from a wide variety of sources, the full source code for all examples used in the text plus further worked examples, e.g., from popular textbooks. The data sets are suitable for illustrating, among other things, the fitting of wage equations, growth regressions, hedonic regressions, dynamic regressions and time series models as well as models of labor force participation or the demand for health care. The goal of this book is to provide a guide to R for users with a background in economics or the social sciences. Readers are assumed to have a background in basic statistics and econometrics at the undergraduate level. A large number of examples should make the book of interest to graduate students, researchers and practitioners alike.

The main goal of our study is to analyse the role of the Mood Maintenance Hypothesis (MMH) in financial markets. MMH refers to people’s tendency to maintain positive mood states, and implies that positive mood is associated with less critical thinking and reduced information processing, yielding three behavioral effects: (i) out of the blue, resulting in stronger negative reactions to bad news during good mood periods, (ii) sunray on a cloudy day, leading to stronger positive reactions to good news during bad mood periods, and (iii) shallow thinking, producing stronger reactions to all kinds of news during good mood periods. Employing daylight duration changes and a measure of onset and recovery from symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) as proxies for contemporaneous investors’ mood, we test the role of mood in investors’ reactions to analyst recommendation revisions. We find corroborative results, most notably that negative stock price reactions to recommendation downgrades are significantly stronger during daylight increasing periods, and, alternatively, during the periods characterized by low rates of onset and high rates of recovery from SAD. The magnitude of the effect increases in longer event windows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,3,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Kliger","given":"Doron"},{"family":"Kudryavtsev","given":"Andrey"}],"citation-key":"kligerOutBlueMood2014","container-title":"Quantitative Finance","DOI":"10.1080/14697688.2012.745646","ISSN":"1469-7688","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,1]]},"page":"629-640","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Out of the blue: mood maintenance hypothesis and seasonal effects on investors’ reaction to news","title-short":"Out of the blue","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14697688.2012.745646","volume":"14"},

We analyse activity traces and success levels for approximately 150 000 self-organized, online team projects. While larger teams tend to be more successful, workload is highly focused across the team, with only a few members performing most work. We find that highly successful teams are significantly more focused than average teams of the same size, that their members have worked on more diverse sets of projects, and the members of highly successful teams are more likely to be core members or ‘leads’ of other teams. The relations between team success and size, focus and especially team experience cannot be explained by confounding factors such as team age, external contributions from non-team members, nor by group mechanisms such as social loafing.

It criticizes Gerschenkron's view that early nineteenth-century English banking developed relatively autonomously from manufacturing. Pointing out that he misunderstood the specific nature of English finance and the reasons that explained the later shift towards speculation, it shows how Gerschenkron and his followers have consistently underestimated the role of the state in shaping the nature of English finance. The main argument of the article is that state intervention was a decisive factor in shaping the nature of English finance. It proved crucial in initiating the divergence between English and continental finance, and contributed to the rise of modern banking in England. Finally, I argue that the speculative configuration of finance often associated with England was a late development of the nineteenth century that again reflected changes in the form of financial and monetary regulation.","author":[{"family":"Knafo","given":"Samuel"}],"citation-key":"knafoStateRiseSpeculative2008","container-title":"Economy and Society","DOI":"10.1080/03085140801933249","ISSN":"0308-5147","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"page":"172-192","source":"Taylor&Francis","title":"The state and the rise of speculative finance in England","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03085140801933249","volume":"37"},

German corporate ownership patterns and restructuring events in the 1990's are examined here in this light. The results show that ownership links among German firms constitute a \"small world\" that has consequences for understanding mergers and acquisitions. Ownership links form closely-knit clusters of firms that are nonetheless highly connected across the network as a whole. Restructuring events fall squarely in the center of this structure. Despite increasing global competition, the German small world tends to replicate itself. To illustrate this robustness, potential disruptions to the observed German network are simulated. This simulation shows that the properties of the small world remain intact even when ownership ties are changed. These findings suggest that a more global economy in Germany need not lead to the dissolution of the ownership structure, but rather may be associated with a deepening of network ties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Kogut","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Walker"}],"citation-key":"kogutSmallWorldGermany2001","container-title":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.2307/3088882","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,6,1]]},"note":"ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Jun., 2001 / Copyright © 2001 American Sociological Association","page":"317-335","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Small World of Germany and the Durability of National Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3088882","volume":"66"},

Qualitative data show that shared culture, specifically “omnivorous”—diverse and inclusive—taste and socialization, signals creative potential to employers and motivates people to pursue creative positions. Structural equation modeling reveals that omnivorous socialization and taste mediate the relationship between class background and creative employment: when middle-class parents expose their children to diverse leisure activities, this exposure has a positive indirect effect on creative employment. It may not actually make those children more creative, but such exposure makes them more likely to enter fields in which they will be viewed as creative. The findings highlight a new direction for research on creativity, contribute to the debate on the role of cultural capital in occupational attainment, and extend knowledge on the early origins of career choice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Koppman","given":"Sharon"}],"citation-key":"koppmanDifferentMeWhy2016","container-title":"Administrative Science Quarterly","container-title-short":"Administrative Science Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/0001839215616840","ISSN":"0001-8392","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"291-331","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Different Like Me: Why Cultural Omnivores Get Creative Jobs","title-short":"Different Like Me","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0001839215616840","volume":"61"},

To address this gap, we integrate the sociology of science with insights from organization theory, which delineates the evaluative advantages bestowed on those with elite status and a consistent professional identity. We use a mixed methods design. Bibliometric data on articles using three unconventional methods in sociology—Correspondence Analysis, Qualitative Comparative Analysis, and Sequence Analysis—allow us to identify which types of scholars have a greater hazard of using unconventional methods and the conditions under which these associations hold. Interviews with published, unpublished, and likely users reveal how scholars manage the career risks associated with unconventional method use. We find that scholars who are male and affiliated with top-tier universities, as well as those already committed to an identity consistent with the use of unconventional methods, have a greater hazard of using them in published work, though these associations depend on the extent to which the method diverges epistemologically from conventional methodology and the visibility of its lineage. In addition, we identify five successful (and two unsuccessful) strategies scholars use to manage their use of unconventional methods. Taken together, results from this mixed methods study advance knowledge on scientific practice, extend organization theory, and provides guidance to policymakers and administrators who aim to foster risky, path-breaking research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Koppman","given":"Sharon"},{"family":"Leahey","given":"Erin"}],"citation-key":"koppmanWhoMovesMethodological2019","container-title":"Research Policy","container-title-short":"Research Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.respol.2019.103807","ISSN":"0048-7333","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"103807","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Who moves to the methodological edge?

Shocks to assets’ liquidity have a common component across measures which accounts for most of the explained variation in individual liquidity measures.

Controlling for across-measure systematic liquidity risk, there is some evidence that liquidity, as a characteristic of assets, is priced in the cross-section. Our results are robust to the inclusion of other equity characteristics and risk factors, such as market capitalization, book-to-market, and momentum.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Korajczyk","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Sadka","given":"Ronnie"}],"citation-key":"korajczykPricingCommonalityAlternative2008","container-title":"Journal of Financial Economics","container-title-short":"Journal of Financial Economics","DOI":"10.1016/j.jfineco.2006.12.003","ISSN":"0304-405X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,1]]},"page":"45-72","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Pricing the commonality across alternative measures of liquidity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X07001572","volume":"87"},
  {"id":"koranDeletionStatisticAccuracy2020","abstract":"Social science researchers now routinely use confirmatory factor models in scale development and validation studies. Methodologists have known for some time that the results of fitting a confirmatory factor model can be unduly influenced by one or a few cases in the data. However, there has been little development and use of case diagnostics for identifying influential cases with confirmatory factor models. A few case deletion statistics have been proposed to identify influential cases in confirmatory factor models. However, these statistics have not been systematically evaluated or compared for their accuracy. This study evaluated the accuracy of three case deletion statistics found in the R package influence.SEM. The accuracy of the case deletion statistics was also compared to Mahalanobis distance, which is commonly used to screen for unusual cases in multivariate applications. A statistical simulation was used to compare the accuracy of the statistics in identifying target cases generated from a model in which variables were uncorrelated. The results showed that Likelihood distance and generalized Cook’s distance detected the target cases more effectively than the Chi-square difference statistic. The accuracy of the Likelihood distance and generalized Cook’s distance statistics was unaffected by model misspecification. The results of this study suggest that Likelihood distance and generalized Cook’s distance are more accurate under more varied conditions in identifying target cases in confirmatory factor models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Koran","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Jaffari","given":"Fathima"}],"citation-key":"koranDeletionStatisticAccuracy2020","container-title":"Methodological Innovations","container-title-short":"Methodological Innovations","DOI":"10.1177/2059799120918349","ISSN":"2059-7991","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2059799120918349","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Deletion statistic accuracy in confirmatory factor models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2059799120918349","volume":"13"},

Many vertex centrality indices were introduced for the first time in the 1950s: e.g., the Bavelas index [50, 51], degree centrality [483] or a first feedback centrality, introduced by Seeley [510]. These early centralities raised a rush of research in which manifold applications were found. However, not every centrality index was suitable to every application, so with time, dozens of new centrality indices were published. This chapter will present some of the more influential, ‘classic’ centrality indices. We do not strive for completeness, but hope to give a catalog of basic centrality indices with some of their main applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,6,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Koschützki","given":"Dirk"},{"family":"Lehmann","given":"Katharina Anna"},{"family":"Peeters","given":"Leon"},{"family":"Richter","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Tenfelde-Podehl","given":"Dagmar"},{"family":"Zlotowski","given":"Oliver"}],"citation-key":"koschutzkiCentralityIndices2005","collection-number":"3418","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"Network Analysis","editor":[{"family":"Brandes","given":"Ulrik"},{"family":"Erlebach","given":"Thomas"}],"ISBN":"978-3-540-24979-5 978-3-540-31955-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,1,1]]},"page":"16-61","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Centrality Indices","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-31955-9_3"},

  {"id":"kovacicAntitrustPolicyCentury1999","abstract":"Passage of the Sherman Act in the United States in 1890 set the stage for a century of jurisprudence regarding monopoly, cartels, and oligopoly. Among American statutes that regulate commerce, the Sherman Act is unequaled in its generality. The Act outlawed every contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade and monopolization and treated violations as crimes. By these open-ended commands, Congress gave federal judges extraordinary power to draw lines between acceptable cooperation and illegal collusion, between vigorous competition and unlawful monopolization.  By enlisting the courts to elaborate the Sherman Act's broad commands, Congress gave economists a singular opportunity to shape competition policy. Because the statute's vital terms directly implicated economic concepts, their interpretation inevitably would invite contributions from economists. What emerged is a convergence of economics and law without parallel in public oversight of business. As economic learning changed, the contours of antitrust doctrine and enforcement policy eventually would shift, as well.  This article follows the evolution of thinking about competition since 1890 as reflected by major antitrust decisions and research in industrial organization. We divide the U.S. antitrust experience into five periods and discuss each period's legal trends and economic thinking in three core areas of antitrust: cartels, cooperation, or other interactions among independent firms; abusive conduct by dominant firms; and mergers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kovacic","given":"William E."},{"family":"Shapiro","given":"Carl"}],"citation-key":"kovacicAntitrustPolicyCentury1999","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,10,1]]},"number":"ID 506284","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Antitrust Policy: A Century of Economic and Legal Thinking","title-short":"Antitrust Policy","type":"report","URL":"http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=506284"},

  {"id":"kozlowskiGeometryCultureAnalyzing2019","abstract":"We argue word embedding models are a useful tool for the study of culture using a historical analysis of shared understandings of social class as an empirical case. Word embeddings represent semantic relations between words as relationships between vectors in a high-dimensional space, specifying a relational model of meaning consistent with contemporary theories of culture. Dimensions induced by word differences (rich – poor) in these spaces correspond to dimensions of cultural meaning, and the projection of words onto these dimensions reflects widely shared associations, which we validate with surveys. Analyzing text from millions of books published over 100 years, we show that the markers of class continuously shifted amidst the economic transformations of the twentieth century, yet the basic cultural dimensions of class remained remarkably stable. The notable exception is education, which became tightly linked to affluence independent of its association with cultivated taste.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Kozlowski","given":"Austin C."},{"family":"Taddy","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Evans","given":"James A."}],"citation-key":"kozlowskiGeometryCultureAnalyzing2019","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/0003122419877135","ISSN":"0003-1224","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,25]]},"language":"en","page":"0003122419877135","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Geometry of Culture: Analyzing the Meanings of Class through Word Embeddings","title-short":"The Geometry of Culture","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122419877135"},

  {"id":"krasnyEffectSocialStatus2013","abstract":"In this chapter, we examine the impact of status-seeking considerations on investors’ portfolio choices and asset prices in a general equilibrium setting. The economy we study consists of traditional (“Markowitz”) investors as well as status-seekers who are concerned about relative wealth. The model highlights the strategic and interdependent nature of portfolio selection in such a setting: low-status investors look for portfolio choices that maximize their chances of moving up the ladder, while high-status investors look to maintain the status quo and hedge against these choices of the low-status investors. In equilibrium, asset returns obey a novel two-factor model in which one factor is the traditional market factor and the other is a particular “high-volatility factor” that does not appear to have been identified so far in the theoretical or empirical literature. We test this two-factor model using stock market data and find significant support for it. Of particular interest is the fact that the model and the empirical results attribute the low returns on idiosyncratic volatility stocks documented by Ang et al. (2006) to their covariance with the portfolio of highly volatile stocks held by investors with relatively low status.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Krasny","given":"Yoel"}],"citation-key":"krasnyEffectSocialStatus2013","container-title":"Security and Privacy in Social Networks","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-4614-4139-7_6","editor":[{"family":"Altshuler","given":"Yaniv"},{"family":"Elovici","given":"Yuval"},{"family":"Cremers","given":"Armin B."},{"family":"Aharony","given":"Nadav"},{"family":"Pentland","given":"Alex"}],"ISBN":"978-1-4614-4138-0 978-1-4614-4139-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"85-131","publisher":"Springer New York","source":"link.springer.com","title":"The Effect of Social Status on Decision-Making and Prices in Financial Networks","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-4139-7_6"},

Further, a feedback acting on the temperature is introduced, such that social temperature reacts to market imbalances and thus becomes time dependent. In this toy market model, social temperature represents nervousness of agents toward market imbalances representing speculative risk. We use the knowledge about the discontinuous generalized voter model phase transition to determine critical fixed points. The system exhibits metastable phases around these fixed points characterized by structured lattice states, with intermittent excursions away from the fixed points.

  {"id":"krippnerFinancializationAmericanEconomy2005","abstract":"This paper presents systematic empirical evidence for the financialization of the US economy in the post-1970s period. While numerous researchers have noted the increasing salience of finance, there have been few systematic attempts to consider what this shift means for the nature of the economy, considered broadly. In large part, this omission reflects the considerable methodological difficulties associated with using national economic data to assess the rise of finance as a macro-level phenomenon shaping patterns of accumulation in the US economy. The paper develops two discrete measures of financialization and applies these measures to postwar US economic data in order to determine if, and to what extent, the US economy is becoming financialized. The paper concludes by considering some of the implications of financialization for two areas of ongoing debate in the social sciences: (1) the question of who controls the modern corporation; and (2) the controversy surrounding the extent to which globalization has eroded the autonomy of the state.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Krippner","given":"Greta R."}],"citation-key":"krippnerFinancializationAmericanEconomy2005","container-title":"Socio-Economic Review","container-title-short":"Socioecon Rev","DOI":"10.1093/SER/mwi008","ISSN":"1475-1461, 1475-147X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,1,5]]},"language":"en","page":"173-208","source":"ser.oxfordjournals.org","title":"The financialization of the American economy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ser.oxfordjournals.org/content/3/2/173","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"kristoufekCanGoogleTrends2013","abstract":"Portfolio diversification and active risk management are essential parts of financial analysis which became even more crucial (and questioned) during and after the years of the Global Financial Crisis. We propose a novel approach to portfolio diversification using the information of searched items on Google Trends. The diversification is based on an idea that popularity of a stock measured by search queries is correlated with the stock riskiness. We penalize the popular stocks by assigning them lower portfolio weights and we bring forward the less popular, or peripheral, stocks to decrease the total riskiness of the portfolio. Our results indicate that such strategy dominates both the benchmark index and the uniformly weighted portfolio both in-sample and out-of-sample.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kristoufek","given":"Ladislav"}],"citation-key":"kristoufekCanGoogleTrends2013","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci.

Compared to the mainstream efficient markets hypothesis, the fractal markets hypothesis considers the financial markets as complex systems consisting of many heterogenous agents, which are distinguishable mainly with respect to their investment horizon. In the paper, several novel measures of trading activity at different investment horizons are introduced through the scaling of variance of the underlying processes. On the three most liquid US indices — DJI, NASDAQ and S&P500 — we show that the predictions of the fractal markets hypothesis actually fit the observed behavior adequately.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Kristoufek","given":"Ladislav"}],"citation-key":"kristoufekFractalMarketsHypothesis2012","container-title":"Advances in Complex Systems","container-title-short":"Advs. Complex Syst.","DOI":"10.1142/S0219525912500658","ISSN":"0219-5259","issue":"06","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,7,8]]},"page":"1250065","source":"worldscientific.com (Atypon)","title":"Fractal markets hypothesis and the global financial crisis: scaling, investment horizons and liquidity","title-short":"Fractal markets hypothesis and the global financial crisis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219525912500658","volume":"15"},

The general interest in the DJIA stocks is thus strongly persistent. We further reinvestigate the cross-correlation structure between the searches, traded volume and volatility of the component stocks using the detrended cross-correlation and detrending moving-average cross-correlation coefficients. Contrary to the universal power-law correlations structure of the related Google searches, the results suggest that there is no universal relationship between the online search queries and the analyzed financial measures.

  {"id":"kroneggerDynamicsNationalScientific2011","abstract":"Coauthorship links actors at the micro-level of scientists. Through electronic databases we now have enough information to compare entire research disciplines over time. We compare the complete longitudinal coauthorship networks for four research disciplines (biotechnology, mathematics, physics and sociology) for 1986–2005. We examined complete bibliographies of all researchers registered at the national Slovene Research Agency. Known hypotheses were confirmed as were three new hypotheses. There were different coauthoring cultures. However, these cultures changed over time in Slovenia. The number of coauthored publications grew much faster than solo authored productions, especially after independence in 1991 and the integration of Slovenian science into broader EU systems. Trajectories of types of coauthorship differed across the disciplines. Using blockmodeling, we show how coauthorship structures change in all disciplines. The most frequent form was a core-periphery structure with multiple simple cores, a periphery and a semi-periphery. The next most frequent form had this structure but with bridging cores. Bridging cores consolidate the center of a discipline by giving it greater coherence. These consolidated structures appeared at different times in different disciplines, appearing earliest in physics and latest in biotechnology. In 2005, biotechnology had the most consolidated center followed by physics and sociology. All coauthorship networks expanded over time. By far, new recruits went into either the semi-periphery or the periphery in all fields. Two ‘lab’ fields, biotechnology and physics, have larger semi-peripheries than peripheries. The reverse holds for mathematics and sociology, two ‘office’ disciplines. Institutional affiliations and shared interests all impact the structure of collaboration in subtle ways.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Kronegger","given":"Luka"},{"family":"Ferligoj","given":"Anuška"},{"family":"Doreian","given":"Patrick"}],"citation-key":"kroneggerDynamicsNationalScientific2011","container-title":"Quality & Quantity","container-title-short":"Qual Quant","DOI":"10.1007/s11135-011-9484-3","ISSN":"0033-5177, 1573-7845","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,3,26]]},"language":"en","page":"989-1015","source":"link.springer.com","title":"On the dynamics of national scientific systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11135-011-9484-3","volume":"45"},
  {"id":"kronkeDynamicsTippingCascades2020","abstract":"Tipping points occur in diverse systems in various disciplines such as ecology, climate science, economy, and engineering. Tipping points are critical thresholds in system parameters or state variables at which a tiny perturbation can lead to a qualitative change of the system. Many systems with tipping points can be modeled as networks of coupled multistable subsystems, e.g., coupled patches of vegetation, connected lakes, interacting climate tipping elements, and multiscale infrastructure systems. In such networks, tipping events in one subsystem are able to induce tipping cascades via domino effects. Here, we investigate the effects of network topology on the occurrence of such cascades. Numerical cascade simulations with a conceptual dynamical model for tipping points are conducted on Erdős-Rényi, Watts-Strogatz, and Barabási-Albert networks. Additionally, we generate more realistic networks using data from moisture-recycling simulations of the Amazon rainforest and compare the results to those obtained for the model networks. We furthermore use a directed configuration model and a stochastic block model which preserve certain topological properties of the Amazon network to understand which of these properties are responsible for its increased vulnerability. We find that clustering and spatial organization increase the vulnerability of networks and can lead to tipping of the whole network. These results could be useful to evaluate which systems are vulnerable or robust due to their network topology and might help us to design or manage systems accordingly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Krönke","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Wunderling","given":"Nico"},{"family":"Winkelmann","given":"Ricarda"},{"family":"Staal","given":"Arie"},{"family":"Stumpf","given":"Benedikt"},{"family":"Tuinenburg","given":"Obbe A."},{"family":"Donges","given":"Jonathan F."}],"citation-key":"kronkeDynamicsTippingCascades2020","container-title":"Physical Review E","container-title-short":"Phys.

Our article introduces organizational science researchers to Bayesian methods and describes why and how they should be used. We use multiple linear regression as the framework to offer a step-by-step demonstration, including the use of software, regarding how to implement Bayesian methods. We explain and illustrate how to determine the prior distribution, compute the posterior distribution, possibly accept the null value, and produce a write-up describing the entire Bayesian process, including graphs, results, and their interpretation. We also offer a summary of the advantages of using Bayesian analysis and examples of how specific published research based on frequentist analysis-based approaches failed to benefit from the advantages offered by a Bayesian approach and how using Bayesian analyses would have led to richer and, in some cases, different substantive conclusions.

  {"id":"kruseMoreSortingMachine2019","abstract":"This article examines the structural conditions that shape ethnic boundary making in the school setting. While previous work has focused on the ethnic composition of student bodies, this study places schools in their institutional and local contexts. The authors argue that the formation of identities and networks varies across local areas depending on the extent of ethnic stratification across schools. Empirically, the authors turn to the case of Germany, where the role of schools as producers of categorical inequalities is particularly obvious. The analysis links large-scale survey data on adolescents’ identification and networks with administrative geocoded information on local stratification across secondary schools. The authors find that minority students in schools with identical ethnic compositions show different inclinations to identify as a majority group member and to form friendships with majority peers, depending on the local extent of ethnic stratification across schools. To place these findings in a cross-national perspective, the authors identify scope conditions of these mechanisms of boundary making and discuss their presence in other countries and school systems. The results support recent theories of immigrant incorporation and offer a more contextualized understanding of ethnic boundary making in schools.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Kruse","given":"Hanno"},{"family":"Kroneberg","given":"Clemens"}],"citation-key":"kruseMoreSortingMachine2019","container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","container-title-short":"American Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1086/705561","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,1]]},"page":"431-484","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"More Than a Sorting Machine: Ethnic Boundary Making in a Stratified School System","title-short":"More Than a Sorting Machine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/705561","volume":"125"},

Using event-related fMRI, we examined whether anticipatory neural activity would predict optimal and suboptimal choices in a financial decision-making task. We characterized two types of deviations from the optimal investment strategy of a rational risk-neutral agent as risk-seeking mistakes and risk-aversion mistakes. Nucleus accumbens activation preceded risky choices as well as risk-seeking mistakes, while anterior insula activation preceded riskless choices as well as risk-aversion mistakes. These findings suggest that distinct neural circuits linked to anticipatory affect promote different types of financial choices and indicate that excessive activation of these circuits may lead to investing mistakes. Thus, consideration of anticipatory neural mechanisms may add predictive power to the rational actor model of economic decision making.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Kuhnen","given":"Camelia M."},{"family":"Knutson","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"kuhnenNeuralBasisFinancial2005","container-title":"Neuron","container-title-short":"Neuron","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuron.2005.08.008","ISSN":"0896-6273","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,9,1]]},"page":"763-770","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The Neural Basis of Financial Risk Taking","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627305006574","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"kumarCorrelationNetworkAnalysis2012","abstract":"Random matrix theory (RMT) and network methods are applied to investigate the correlation and network properties of 20 financial indices. The results are compared before and during the financial crisis of 2008. In the RMT method, the components of eigenvectors corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue form two clusters of indices in the positive and negative directions. The components of these two clusters switch in opposite directions during the crisis. The network analysis uses the Fruchterman-Reingold layout to find clusters in the network of indices at different thresholds. At a threshold of 0.6, before the crisis, financial indices corresponding to the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific form separate clusters. On the other hand, during the crisis at the same threshold, the American and European indices combine together to form a strongly linked cluster while the Asia-Pacific indices form a separate weakly linked cluster. If the value of the threshold is further increased to 0.9 then the European indices (France, Germany, and the United Kingdom) are found to be the most tightly linked indices. The structure of the minimum spanning tree of financial indices is more starlike before the crisis and it changes to become more chainlike during the crisis. The average linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to find a clearer cluster structure in the network of financial indices. The cophenetic correlation coefficients are calculated and found to increase significantly, which indicates that the hierarchy increases during the financial crisis. These results show that there is substantial change in the structure of the organization of financial indices during a financial crisis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Kumar","given":"Sunil"},{"family":"Deo","given":"Nivedita"}],"citation-key":"kumarCorrelationNetworkAnalysis2012","container-title":"Physical Review E","container-title-short":"Phys.

Regression analysis demonstrates that author reputation, article length, and quality of publishing journal are strong determinants of article popularity. The relative importance of various economics journals, though not their rankings, is sensitive to inclusion of “hit” articles; the differential impact of a journal may be more closely approximated by its ability to attract a significant proportion of the “hit parade” of articles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Laband","given":"David N."}],"citation-key":"labandArticlePopularity1986","container-title":"Economic Inquiry","DOI":"10.1111/j.1465-7295.1986.tb01804.x","ISSN":"1465-7295","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1986,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"173-180","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Article Popularity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-7295.1986.tb01804.x/abstract","volume":"24"},

This increased emphasis was, and continues to be, reflected in a variety of increased incentives for faculty to produce research, including higher salaries, reduced teaching loads, increased money for travel, on so on. Yet, as we report in this paper, during this time period the rate of uncitedness of economics papers remained constant (at 26 percent). Clearly, universities and taxpayers/supporters of universities are obtaining no enhancement of research output (in terms of citations) from the increased subsidy to faculty research. We discuss the implications of this result for the publication and organization of economic research. In particular, we discuss the fact that resources devoted to up-front screening of papers by authors and journals have risen substantially over this period, but to no avail with respect to reducing the incidence of dry holes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Laband","given":"David N."},{"family":"Tollison","given":"Robert D."}],"citation-key":"labandDryHolesEconomic2003","container-title":"Kyklos","DOI":"10.1111/1467-6435.00215","ISSN":"1467-6435","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"161-173","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Dry Holes in Economic Research","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-6435.00215/abstract","volume":"56"},

It is commonly implied that there is such a thing as a complex system, different examples of which are studied across many disciplines. However, there is no concise definition of a complex system, let alone a definition on which all scientists agree. We review various attempts to characterize a complex system, and consider a core set of features that are widely associated with complex systems in the literature and by those in the field. We argue that some of these features are neither necessary nor sufficient for complexity, and that some of them are too vague or confused to be of any analytical use. In order to bring mathematical rigour to the issue we then review some standard measures of complexity from the scientific literature, and offer a taxonomy for them, before arguing that the one that best captures the qualitative notion of the order produced by complex systems is that of the Statistical Complexity. Finally, we offer our own list of necessary conditions as a characterization of complexity. These conditions are qualitative and may not be jointly sufficient for complexity. We close with some suggestions for future work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Ladyman","given":"James"},{"family":"Lambert","given":"James"},{"family":"Wiesner","given":"Karoline"}],"citation-key":"ladymanWhatComplexSystem2013","container-title":"European Journal for Philosophy of Science","container-title-short":"Euro Jnl Phil Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s13194-012-0056-8","ISSN":"1879-4920","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"33-67","source":"Springer Link","title":"What is a complex system?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13194-012-0056-8","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"lambEcologyHumanCarnivore2020","abstract":"<p>With a shrinking supply of wilderness and growing recognition that top predators can have a profound influence on ecosystems, the persistence of large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes has emerged as one of the greatest conservation challenges of our time. Carnivores fascinate society, yet these animals pose threats to people living near them, resulting in high rates of carnivore death near human settlements. We used 41 y of demographic data for more than 2,500 brown bears—one of the world’s most widely distributed and conflict-prone carnivores—to understand the behavioral and demographic mechanisms promoting carnivore coexistence in human-dominated landscapes. Bear mortality was high and unsustainable near people, but a human-induced shift to nocturnality facilitated lower risks of bear mortality and rates of conflict with people. Despite these behavioral shifts, projected population growth rates for bears in human-dominated areas revealed a source-sink dynamic. Despite some female bears successfully reproducing in the sink areas, bear persistence was reliant on a supply of immigrants from areas with minimal human influence (i.e., wilderness). Such mechanisms of coexistence reveal a striking paradox: Connectivity to wilderness areas supplies bears that likely will die from people, but these bears are essential to avert local extirpation. These insights suggest carnivores contribute to human–carnivore coexistence through behavioral and demographic mechanisms, and that connected wilderness is critical to sustain coexistence landscapes.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Lamb","given":"Clayton T."},{"family":"Ford","given":"Adam T."},{"family":"McLellan","given":"Bruce N."},{"family":"Proctor","given":"Michael F."},{"family":"Mowat","given":"Garth"},{"family":"Ciarniello","given":"Lana"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Scott E."},{"family":"Boutin","given":"Stan"}],"citation-key":"lambEcologyHumanCarnivore2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1922097117","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,6]]},"language":"en","PMID":"32632004","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"The ecology of human–carnivore coexistence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/07/02/1922097117"},

  {"id":"lamontHowProfessorsThink2009","abstract":"Excellence. Originality. Intelligence. Everyone in academia stresses quality. But what exactly is it, and how do professors identify it? In the academic evaluation system known as “peer review,” highly respected professors pass judgment, usually confidentially, on the work of others. But only those present in the deliberative chambers know exactly what is said. Michle Lamont observed deliberations for fellowships and research grants, and interviewed panel members at length. In How Professors Think, she reveals what she discovered about this secretive, powerful, peculiar world. Anthropologists, political scientists, literary scholars, economists, historians, and philosophers don’t share the same standards. Economists prefer mathematical models, historians favor different kinds of evidence, and philosophers don’t care much if only other philosophers understand them. But when they come together for peer assessment, academics are expected to explain their criteria, respect each other’s expertise, and guard against admiring only work that resembles their own. They must decide: Is the research original and important? Brave, or glib? Timely, or merely trendy? Pro-diversity or interdisciplinary enough?Judging quality isn’t robotically rational; it’s emotional, cognitive, and social, too. Yet most academics’ self-respect is rooted in their ability to analyze complexity and recognize quality, in order to come to the fairest decisions about that elusive god, “excellence.” In How Professors Think, Lamont aims to illuminate the confidential process of evaluation and to push the gatekeepers to both better understand and perform their role.","author":[{"family":"Lamont","given":"Michèle"},{"family":"Lamont","given":"Professor of Sociology Michele"}],"citation-key":"lamontHowProfessorsThink2009","ISBN":"978-0-674-03266-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,3,31]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"337","publisher":"Harvard University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"How Professors Think","type":"book"},

However, even though the theory was articulated in dynamic terms, previous research has almost exclusively tested it through cross-sectional analyses. The aim of this study is to disentangle the dynamic character of ethnic competition from more permanent determinants of ethnic threat. The findings show that a remarkable variation of concern over immigration, usually attributed to permanent positions of economic vulnerability, disappears when within-person variation is modeled. In line with a dynamic approach of ethnic competition, becoming unemployed or being laid off increases concern over immigration.

The paper discourse-analyses a campaign by institutional entrepreneurs ? mainly representatives of commercial banks ? who attempted to homogenize the criteria of organizational legitimacy in the German banking sector by questioning the fundamentals of the three-pillar system and the non-commercial banks. Institutional entrepreneurs are understood as discursive entrepreneurs whose actions refer to institutionalized generalizations of value.

This transformation is understood to entail the lengthening of mortgage networks and their increased interconnection with the multiple networks of the capital markets; the making of suburban subjects as property investors in order to produce and extend mortgage borrowing in a booming housing market; and, in particular, the constitution of mortgage-backed securitisation (MBS) techniques through the calculative tools of off-balance sheet accounting, asset management, and credit rating. MBS is the practice of ‘bundling’ together a stream of future obligations arising from mortgagors repayments to provide the basis for the issue of, and the payment of principal and interest on, securities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Langley","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"langleySecuritisingSuburbiaTransformation2006","container-title":"Competition & Change","container-title-short":"Competition & Change","DOI":"10.1179/102452906X114384","ISSN":"1024-5294","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"283-299","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Securitising Suburbia: The Transformation of Anglo-American Mortgage Finance","title-short":"Securitising Suburbia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/102452906X114384","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"lanteriEconomicsEconomistsInstitutional2014","abstract":"The profession of academic economics has been widely criticized for being excessively dependent on technical models based on unrealistic assumptions about rationality and individual behavior, and yet it remains a sparsely studied area. This volume presents a series of background readings on the profession by leading scholars in the history of economic thought and economic methodology. Adopting a fresh critique, the contributors investigate the individual incentives prevalent in academic economics, describing economists as rational actors who react to their intellectual environment and the incentives for economic research. Timely topics are addressed, including the financial crisis and the consequences for the discipline, as well as more traditional themes such as pluralism in research, academic organizations, teaching methodology, gender issues and professional ethics.

  {"id":"lapavitsasInformationTrustSocial2007","abstract":"Abstract According to mainstream economic theory the contractual relationship between borrower and lender is characterized by asymmetry of information regarding the project to be financed. It is assumed that trust among credit participants is constructed individually as they collect and assess requisite information. In contrast, this paper argues that trust and information among credit participants have compelling social constituents that depend on economic function and social context. More specifically, the paper shows that financial institutions transform trust into a social and objective relationship. The capitalist credit system comprises a set of institutions that construct trust socially by using increasingly general information. Nonetheless, the foundation of credit-related trust is the ability to repay money. Hence the moral content of credit is thin, giving rise to fraud and deception.","author":[{"family":"Lapavitsas","given":"Costas"}],"citation-key":"lapavitsasInformationTrustSocial2007","container-title":"Economy and Society","DOI":"10.1080/03085140701428381","ISSN":"0308-5147","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"page":"416-436","source":"Taylor&Francis","title":"Information and trust as social aspects of credit","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03085140701428381","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"laportaInvestorProtectionCorporate2000","abstract":"Recent research has documented large differences among countries in ownership concentration in publicly traded firms, in the breadth and depth of capital markets, in dividend policies, and in the access of firms to external finance. A common element to the explanations of these differences is how well investors, both shareholders and creditors, are protected by law from expropriation by the managers and controlling shareholders of firms. We describe the differences in laws and the effectiveness of their enforcement across countries, discuss the possible origins of these differences, summarize their consequences, and assess potential strategies of corporate governance reform. We argue that the legal approach is a more fruitful way to understand corporate governance and its reform than the conventional distinction between bank-centered and market-centered financial systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"La Porta","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Lopez-de-Silanes","given":"Florencio"},{"family":"Shleifer","given":"Andrei"},{"family":"Vishny","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"laportaInvestorProtectionCorporate2000","collection-title":"Special Issue on International Corporate Governance","container-title":"Journal of Financial Economics","container-title-short":"Journal of Financial Economics","DOI":"10.1016/S0304-405X(00)00065-9","ISSN":"0304-405X","issue":"1–2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"page":"3-27","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Investor protection and corporate governance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X00000659","volume":"58"},

  {"id":"lareauCulturalCapitalEducational2003","abstract":"In this article, we assess how the concept of cultural capital has been imported into the English language, focusing on educational research. We argue that a dominant interpretation of cultural capital has coalesced with two central premises. First, cultural capital denotes knowledge of or facility with “highbrow” aesthetic culture. Secondly, cultural capital is analytically and causally distinct from other important forms of knowledge or competence (termed “technical skills,” “human capital,” etc.). We then review Bourdieu’s educational writings to demonstrate that neither of these premises is essential to his understanding of cultural capital. In the third section, we discuss a set of English-language studies that draw on the concept of cultural capital, but eschew the dominant interpretation. These serve as the point of departure for an alternative definition. Our definition emphasizes Bourdieu’s reference to the capacity of a social class to “impose” advantageous standards of evaluation on the educational institution. We discuss the empirical requirements that adherence to such a definition entails for researchers, and provide a brief illustration of the intersection of institutionalized evaluative standards and the educational practices of families belonging to different social classes. Using ethnographic data from a study of social class differences in family-school relationships, we show how an African-American middle-class family exhibits cultural capital in a way that an African-American family below the poverty level does not.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Lareau","given":"Annette"},{"family":"Weininger","given":"Elliot B."}],"citation-key":"lareauCulturalCapitalEducational2003","container-title":"Theory and Society","container-title-short":"Theory and Society","DOI":"10.1023/B:RYSO.0000004951.04408.b0","ISSN":"0304-2421, 1573-7853","issue":"5-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"567-606","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Cultural capital in educational research: A critical assessment","title-short":"Cultural capital in educational research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:RYSO.0000004951.04408.b0","volume":"32"},

It shows that the proportion of WoS papers found on arXiv varies across the specialties of physics and mathematics, and that only a few specialties make extensive use of the repository. Elapsed time between arXiv submission and journal publication has shortened but remains longer in mathematics than in physics. In physics, mathematics, as well as in astronomy and astrophysics, arXiv versions are cited more promptly and decay faster than WoS papers.

  {"id":"larsenRateGrowthScientific2010","abstract":"The growth rate of scientific publication has been studied from 1907 to 2007 using available data from a number of literature databases, including Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). Traditional scientific publishing, that is publication in peer-reviewed journals, is still increasing although there are big differences between fields. There are no indications that the growth rate has decreased in the last 50 years. At the same time publication using new channels, for example conference proceedings, open archives and home pages, is growing fast. The growth rate for SCI up to 2007 is smaller than for comparable databases. This means that SCI was covering a decreasing part of the traditional scientific literature. There are also clear indications that the coverage by SCI is especially low in some of the scientific areas with the highest growth rate, including computer science and engineering sciences. The role of conference proceedings, open access archives and publications published on the net is increasing, especially in scientific fields with high growth rates, but this has only partially been reflected in the databases. The new publication channels challenge the use of the big databases in measurements of scientific productivity or output and of the growth rate of science. Because of the declining coverage and this challenge it is problematic that SCI has been used and is used as the dominant source for science indicators based on publication and citation numbers. The limited data available for social sciences show that the growth rate in SSCI was remarkably low and indicate that the coverage by SSCI was declining over time. National Science Indicators from Thomson Reuters is based solely on SCI, SSCI and Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). Therefore the declining coverage of the citation databases problematizes the use of this source.","author":[{"family":"Larsen","given":"Peder Olesen"},{"family":"Ins","given":"Markus","non-dropping-particle":"von"}],"citation-key":"larsenRateGrowthScientific2010","container-title":"Scientometrics","container-title-short":"Scientometrics","DOI":"10.1007/s11192-010-0202-z","ISSN":"0138-9130","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,9]]},"page":"575-603","PMCID":"PMC2909426","PMID":"20700371","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The rate of growth in scientific publication and the decline in coverage provided by Science Citation Index","type":"article-journal","volume":"84"},

We propose here an extension of the most basic notions used nowadays to analyse large one-mode networks (the classical case) to the two-mode case. To achieve this, we introduce a set of simple statistics, which we discuss by comparing their values on a representative set of real-world networks and on their random versions.

But this body of work on the sociology of social research does not hang together in ways that it could, and should, if knowledge is to accumulate. Contributors hail from various fields, subfields, theoretical perspectives, and methodological bents, and there is no extant subfield to join, legitimate, and reinforce their mutual interests. Thus, the aim of this review is not only to summarize themes, identify gaps, and suggest fruitful avenues for future research, but also to serve as a unifying force for scholars interested in studying social science from a sociological perspective. The sociology of social research, far from being a trite exercise in navel-gazing, is critical for the future viability of sociology, for the discipline's legitimacy and autonomy, and for improving social research more generally.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Leahey","given":"Erin"}],"citation-key":"leaheyMethodologicalMemesMores2008","container-title":"Annual Review of Sociology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.soc.34.040507.134731","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.34.040507.134731","page":"33-53","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Methodological Memes and Mores: Toward a Sociology of Social Research","title-short":"Methodological Memes and Mores","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.34.040507.134731","volume":"34"},
  {"id":"leaheyNotProductivityAlone2007","abstract":"The popular adage “publish or perish” has long defined individual career strategies as well as scholarly investigations of earnings inequality in academe, as researchers have relied heavily on research productivity to explain earnings inequality among faculty members. Academia, however, has changed dramatically in the last few decades: it has become larger and more demographically diverse, and fears of overspecialization prompt calls for interdisciplinary approaches. In this new environment, other factors, in addition to productivity, are likely relevant to our understanding of earnings differentials. In this article, I assess whether two additional factors—visibility and the extent of research specialization—contribute to men's earning advantage. Using probability samples of tenure-track academics in two disciplines, a variety of data sources, and innovative measures, I find that both factors are highly relevant to the process by which earnings are determined. Women earn less than men largely because they specialize less. Lower levels of specialization hinder productivity, productivity enhances visibility, and visibility has a direct, positive, and significant effect on salary. I discuss the practical implications of these findings and lay the foundation for a broader theory of the role of research specialization in work processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Leahey","given":"Erin"}],"citation-key":"leaheyNotProductivityAlone2007","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.1177/000312240707200403","ISSN":"0003-1224, 1939-8271","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"533-561","source":"asr.sagepub.com","title":"Not by Productivity Alone: How Visibility and Specialization Contribute to Academic Earnings","title-short":"Not by Productivity Alone","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://asr.sagepub.com/content/72/4/533","volume":"72"},
  {"id":"leaheyProminentLessProductive2017","abstract":"Federal agencies and universities in the U.S. promote interdisciplinary research because it presumably spurs transformative, innovative science. Using data on almost 900 research-center–based scientists and their 32,000 published articles, along with a set of unpublished papers, we assess whether such research is indeed beneficial and whether costs accompany the potential benefits. Existing research highlights this tension: whereas the innovation literature suggests that spanning disciplines is beneficial because it allows scientists to see connections across fields, the categories literature suggests that spanning disciplines is penalized because the resulting research may be lower quality or confusing to place. To investigate this, we empirically distinguish production and reception effects and highlight a new production penalty: lower productivity, which may be attributable to cognitive and collaborative challenges associated with interdisciplinary research and/or hurdles in the review process. Using an innovative measure of interdisciplinary research that considers the similarity of the disciplines spanned, we document both penalties (fewer papers published) and benefits (increased citations) associated with it and show that it is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor, one that partly depends on field-level interdisciplinarity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Leahey","given":"Erin"},{"family":"Beckman","given":"Christine M."},{"family":"Stanko","given":"Taryn L."}],"citation-key":"leaheyProminentLessProductive2017","container-title":"Administrative Science Quarterly","container-title-short":"Administrative Science Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/0001839216665364","ISSN":"0001-8392","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"105-139","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Prominent but Less Productive: The Impact of Interdisciplinarity on Scientists’ Research","title-short":"Prominent but Less Productive","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0001839216665364","volume":"62"},

Classic research on recombinant innovation suggests that domain-spanning fosters the accumulation of diverse information and can thus be a springboard for fresh ideas—most of which emanate from the merger of extant ideas from distinct realms. But domain-spanning is also challenging to produce and to evaluate. Here, the domains of interest are subfields. We focus on subfield spanning in sociology, a topically diverse field whose distinct subfields are still reasonably permeable. To do so, we introduce two measures of subfield integration, one of which uniquely accounts for the novelty of subfield combinations. We find (within the limits of observable data) the costs to be minimal but the rewards substantial: Once published, sociology articles that integrate subfields (especially rarely spanned subfields) garner more citations.

Using data on sociology PhD recipients in 1972–1976, we construct a measure of research specialization and add it to a traditional attainment model that includes productivity, visibility, and prestige of specialty area(s).

Because much of the tacit knowledge required to succeed in professions such as academia cannot be obtained formally, informal channels of learning--such as interaction with advisors--may be crucial. In this paper I test the extent to which graduate school advisors influence the development of their advisees' research habits, practices, and beliefs. I find that advisors' attitudes and intra-professional standing affect how their advisees view various research practices--both those that are less codified (such as how to deal with anomalous data) and those that are quite standardized (such as statistical significance testing). For the least standardized and most qualitative research practices, such as interpreting qualitative text, I find that students' experiences are more relevant that advisors' attitudes.

  {"id":"leaheyWhatTypesNovelty2021","abstract":"This work builds on recent advances in the study of novelty and impact to investigate whether novel scientific papers tend to disrupt the scientific literature, and whether some types of novelty are more disruptive than others. We develop a computational measure to capture the ways in which scientific articles are novel (e.g., developing a new method or presenting a new result). We also utilize Funk and Owen-Smith’s (2017) CD index to capture the different ways an article can influence a stream of literature: by consolidating (C) or disrupting (D) the status quo. Drawing upon classic sociology of science scholarship on the distinction between cumulative normal science research and non-cumulative paradigm shifts (Kuhn 1962; 1977), we develop hypotheses about which type of novelty is more likely to disrupt knowledge streams and which is more likely to consolidate them. By integrating data from the Web of Science (to measure the nature of scientific influence) with reflective essays written by authors of Citation Classics (to access novelty claims) and by joining computational text analysis with statistical analyses, we demonstrate clear and robust patterns between type of novelty and the nature of scientific influence. As we expected, articles that develop and present a new method tend to be more disruptive, likely because they tend to cross disciplinary divides, which boost creative insight and alters citation patterns (Abbott 2004; Koppman & Leahey 2019). To our surprise, new theory (especially the most abstract kind of theory) is associated with a more consolidating type of influence. This may be attributable to the nature of theory and theory-building, which tends to involve synthesis and bricolage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Leahey","given":"Erin"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jina"},{"family":"Funk","given":"Russell James"}],"citation-key":"leaheyWhatTypesNovelty2021","container-title":"Academy of Management Proceedings","container-title-short":"Proceedings","DOI":"10.5465/AMBPP.2021.15612abstract","ISSN":"0065-0668","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,1]]},"page":"15612","publisher":"Academy of Management","source":"journals.aom.org (Atypon)","title":"What types of novelty are most disruptive?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMBPP.2021.15612abstract","volume":"2021"},

Actors who overcome this trade-off transition from a closed network to an open network; those who fail to do so can be caught in a survival trap that jeopardizes their chances of having a successful career. We identify the factors that enable and constrain network transitions and test our theory on a sample of Korean pop (K-pop) freelance songwriters before they have attained their first commercial hit. These songwriters initially rely on a closed network of collaborators and transition toward an open network by working with fellow songwriters who are not connected to those collaborators. This network transition occurs faster among songwriters who eventually attain their first hit than among those who remain unsuccessful. Songwriters are more likely to collaborate with new distant colleagues when they have a reference group of commercially successful peers and when they have created stylistically similar songs in the past that have failed to become hits. However, most of their new distant colleagues also lack a hit, revealing a status barrier that constrains the network transition of early-career songwriters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Yonghoon G."},{"family":"Gargiulo","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"leeEscapingSurvivalTrap2021","container-title":"Administrative Science Quarterly","container-title-short":"Administrative Science Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/00018392211055198","ISSN":"0001-8392","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]]},"language":"en","page":"00018392211055198","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Escaping the Survival Trap: Network Transition among Early-Career Freelance Songwriters","title-short":"Escaping the Survival Trap","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00018392211055198"},

  {"id":"leeQUBEQuickAlgorithm2012","abstract":"The betweenness centrality of a vertex in a graph is a measure for the participation of the vertex in the shortest paths in the graph. The Betweenness centrality is widely used in network analyses. Especially in a social network, the recursive computation of the betweenness centralities of vertices is performed for the community detection and finding the influential user in the network. Since a social network graph is frequently updated, it is necessary to update the betweenness centrality efficiently. When a graph is changed, the betweenness centralities of all the vertices should be recomputed from scratch using all the vertices in the graph. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes an efficient algorithm which handles the update of the betweenness centralities of vertices in a graph. In this paper, we propose a method that efficiently reduces the search space by finding a candidate set of vertices whose betweenness centralities can be updated and computes their betweenness centeralities using candidate vertices only. As the cost of calculating the betweenness centrality mainly depends on the number of vertices to be considered, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the cost of calculation. The proposed algorithm allows the transformation of an existing algorithm which does not consider the graph update. Experimental results on large real datasets show that the proposed algorithm speeds up the existing algorithm 2 to 2418 times depending on the dataset.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Min-Joong"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jungmin"},{"family":"Park","given":"Jaimie Yejean"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Ryan Hyun"},{"family":"Chung","given":"Chin-Wan"}],"citation-key":"leeQUBEQuickAlgorithm2012","collection-title":"WWW '12","container-title":"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web","DOI":"10.1145/2187836.2187884","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-1229-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"351–360","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"QUBE: A Quick Algorithm for Updating Betweenness Centrality","title-short":"QUBE","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2187836.2187884"},

But how does the expansion of police presence in poor urban communities affect educational outcomes? Previous research points at multiple mechanisms with opposing effects. This article presents the first causal evidence of the impact of aggressive policing on minority youths’ educational performance. Under Operation Impact, the New York Police Department (NYPD) saturated high-crime areas with additional police officers with the mission to engage in aggressive, order-maintenance policing. To estimate the effect of this policing program, we use administrative data from more than 250,000 adolescents age 9 to 15 and a difference-in-differences approach based on variation in the timing of police surges across neighborhoods. We find that exposure to police surges significantly reduced test scores for African American boys, consistent with their greater exposure to policing. The size of the effect increases with age, but there is no discernible effect for African American girls and Hispanic students. Aggressive policing can thus lower educational performance for some minority groups. These findings provide evidence that the consequences of policing extend into key domains of social life, with implications for the educational trajectories of minority youth and social inequality more broadly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Legewie","given":"Joscha"},{"family":"Fagan","given":"Jeffrey"}],"citation-key":"legewieAggressivePolicingEducational2019","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/0003122419826020","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"220-247","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Aggressive Policing and the Educational Performance of Minority Youth","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122419826020","volume":"84"},

Financial message boards provide a unique medium to analyze individuals’ attention to accounting information on a large scale and in great detail. I examine accounting-related content in 1.94 million messages for 1,852 firms and find that individual investors pay considerable attention to accounting information. In accordance with the expectation that investors react to relevant information events, I find that accounting-related discussion is significantly elevated around earnings releases, 8-K reports, quarterly reports, and annual reports of the smallest firms. I also examine whether investors expand their accounting information acquisition and processing efforts in poor information climates. I show that accounting-related discussion increases in an environment of greater uncertainty, measured by information availability (lower analyst coverage), information precision (higher analyst forecast dispersion), and information ambiguity (higher trading volume). Lastly, I propose that greater attention to accounting information may be associated with evidence of a better-informed investor. I find that higher accounting discussion around earnings announcements is associated with a reduction in information asymmetry but no evidence of a reduction in the post earnings announcement drift.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Lerman","given":"Alina"}],"citation-key":"lermanIndividualInvestorsAttention2011","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,4,1]]},"number":"ID 1540689","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Individual Investors' Attention to Accounting Information: Message Board Discussions","title-short":"Individual Investors' Attention to Accounting Information","type":"report","URL":"http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1540689"},

The concentration of entrepreneurs in regions such as Silicon Valley has stimulated research and policy interest into the influence of peers, but the causal effect is hard to identify empirically. We exploit the exogenous assignment of students into business-school sections to identify the causal effect of entrepreneurial peers. We show that, in contrast to prior findings, a higher share of entrepreneurial peers decreases, rather than increases, entrepreneurship. The decrease is driven by a reduction in unsuccessful entrepreneurial ventures; the effect on successful ventures is significantly more positive.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Lerner","given":"Josh"},{"family":"Malmendier","given":"Ulrike"}],"citation-key":"lernerLittleHelpMy2013","container-title":"Review of Financial Studies","container-title-short":"Rev.

  {"id":"leskovecCommunityStructureLarge2008","abstract":"A large body of work has been devoted to defining and identifying clusters or communities in social and information networks. We explore from a novel perspective several questions related to identifying meaningful communities in large social and information networks, and we come to several striking conclusions. We employ approximation algorithms for the graph partitioning problem to characterize as a function of size the statistical and structural properties of partitions of graphs that could plausibly be interpreted as communities. In particular, we define the network community profile plot, which characterizes the \"best\" possible community--according to the conductance measure--over a wide range of size scales. We study over 100 large real-world social and information networks. Our results suggest a significantly more refined picture of community structure in large networks than has been appreciated previously. In particular, we observe tight communities that are barely connected to the rest of the network at very small size scales; and communities of larger size scales gradually \"blend into\" the expander-like core of the network and thus become less \"community-like.\" This behavior is not explained, even at a qualitative level, by any of the commonly-used network generation models. Moreover, it is exactly the opposite of what one would expect based on intuition from expander graphs, low-dimensional or manifold-like graphs, and from small social networks that have served as testbeds of community detection algorithms. We have found that a generative graph model, in which new edges are added via an iterative \"forest fire\" burning process, is able to produce graphs exhibiting a network community profile plot similar to what we observe in our network datasets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Leskovec","given":"Jure"},{"family":"Lang","given":"Kevin J."},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Anirban"},{"family":"Mahoney","given":"Michael W."}],"citation-key":"leskovecCommunityStructureLarge2008","container-title":"arXiv:0810.1355 [physics]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,10,8]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Community Structure in Large Networks: Natural Cluster Sizes and the Absence of Large Well-Defined Clusters","title-short":"Community Structure in Large Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1355"},
  {"id":"leszczenskyEthnicSegregationFriendship2015","abstract":"Adolescents’ school-based friendship networks tend to be segregated along ethnic lines. But few studies have examined whether variation in network boundaries affects the degree of ethnic friendship segregation. We use rational-choice theory to argue that ethnic homophily is more pronounced for friendships between classrooms than for those within classrooms. We empirically test this hypothesis using two-wave German panel data (N = 1258) and stochastic actor-oriented models (RSiena). In line with our theoretical argument, we find that the tendency to form same-ethnic friendships is indeed stronger at the grade level, which translates into stronger ethnic segregation in friendship networks at the grade level than at the classroom level.

  {"id":"letinaNetworkActorAttribute2016","abstract":"The aim of this study is to explore the network effects of the national and disciplinary community and actor attribute effects on the future performance of scientists in two fields of social sciences in Croatia. Based on the publication data from 1992 to 2012, extracted from three databases, we used the co-authorship network from the period 1992–2001 for the specification of nine structural effects to predict individual performance in the 2002–2012 period. Employing the auto-logistic actor attribute models allowed the inclusion of six actor attributes and the analysis of their effects simultaneously with network effects. The results show that future performance is dependent on the national and disciplinary network both in the psychology field and in the sociology field. When controlling for actor attribute effects, these structural effects play a significant role only in sociology, where activity in the network is a negative predictor and having a tie with an actor who is going to be above average in productivity is a positive predictor of the outcome. Institution type in psychology, age and the previous productivity in sociology are significant actor attribute effects. We used log-odds to demonstrate the probabilities of the outcome for three prototypical egonet structures: open, closed and complex; with different numbers of alters with attribute.

In the first “bootstrap” stage, a collection of high-precision features is used to bootstrap a training set with positive and negative examples of coreferring authors. A supervised feature-based classifier is then trained on the bootstrap clusters and used to cluster the authors in a larger unlabeled dataset. Our self-supervised approach shares the advantages of unsupervised approaches (no need for expensive hand labels) as well as supervised approaches (a rich set of features that can be discriminatively trained). The algorithm disambiguates 54,000,000 author instances in Thomson Reuters' Web of Knowledge with B3 F1 of.807. We analyze parameters and features, particularly those from citation networks, which have not been deeply investigated in author disambiguation. The most important citation feature is self-citation, which can be approximated without expensive extraction of the full network. For the supervised stage, the minor improvement due to other citation features (increasing F1 from.748 to.767) suggests they may not be worth the trouble of extracting from databases that don't already have them. A lean feature set without expensive abstract and title features performs 130 times faster with about equal F1.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Levin","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Krawczyk","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Bethard","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Jurafsky","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"levinCitationbasedBootstrappingLargescale2012","container-title":"Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology","container-title-short":"J Am Soc Inf Sci Tec","DOI":"10.1002/asi.22621","ISSN":"1532-2890","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1030-1047","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Citation-based bootstrapping for large-scale author disambiguation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.22621/abstract","volume":"63"},

  {"id":"levineVisionsSociologicalTradition1995","abstract":"Don Levine moves from the origins of systematic knowledge in ancient Greece to the present day to present an account that is at once a history of the social science enterprise and an introduction to the cornerstone works of Western social thought.  \"Visions\" has three meanings, each of which corresponds to a part of the book. In Part 1, Levine presents the ways previous sociologists have rendered accounts of their discipline, as a series of narratives—or \"life stories\"—that build upon each other, generation to generation, a succession of efforts to envisage a coherent past for the sake of a purposive present.  In Part 2, the heart of the book, Levine offers his own narrative, reconnecting centuries of voices into a richly textured dialogue among the varied strands of the sociological tradition: Hellenic, British, French, German, Marxian, Italian, and American. Here, in a tour de force of clarity and conciseness, he tracks the formation of the sociological imagination through a series of conversations across generations. From classic philosophy to pragmatism, Aristotle to W. I. Thomas, Levine maps the web of visionary statements—confrontations and oppositions—from which social science has grown.  At the same time, this is much more than an expert synthesis of social theory. Throughout each stage, Levine demonstrates social knowledge has grown in response to three recurring questions: How shall we live? What makes humans moral creatures? How do we understand the world? He anchors the creation of social knowledge to ethical foundations, and shows for the first time how differences in those foundations disposed the shapers of modern social science—among them, Marshall and Spencer, Comte and Durkheim, Simmel and Weber, Marx and Mosca, Dewey and Park—to proceed in vastly different ways.  In Part 3, Levine offers a vision of the contemporary scene, setting the crisis of fragmentation in social sciences against the fragmentation of experience and community. By reconstructing the history of social thought as a series of fundamentally moral engagements with common themes, he suggests new uses for sociology's intellectual resources: not only as insight about the nature of modernity, but also as a model of mutually respectful communication in an increasingly fractious world.","author":[{"family":"Levine","given":"Donald N."}],"citation-key":"levineVisionsSociologicalTradition1995","ISBN":"978-0-226-47547-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995,9]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"379","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Visions of the Sociological Tradition","type":"book"},

We argue that a neighborhood’s well-being depends not only on its own socioeconomic conditions but also on the conditions of neighborhoods its residents visit and are visited by, connections that form through networks of everyday urban mobility. We construct measures of mobility-based disadvantage using geocoded patterns of movement estimated from hundreds of millions of tweets sent by nearly 400,000 Twitter users over 18 months. Analyzing nearly 32,000 neighborhoods and 9,700 homicides in 37 of the largest U.S. cities, we show that neighborhood triple disadvantage independently predicts homicides, adjusting for traditional neighborhood correlates of violence, spatial proximity to disadvantage, prior homicides, and city fixed effects. Not only is triple disadvantage a stronger predictor than traditional measures, it accounts for a sizable portion of the association between residential neighborhood disadvantage and homicides. In turn, potential mechanisms such as neighborhood drug activity, interpersonal friction, and gun crime prevalence account for much of the association between triple disadvantage and homicides. These findings implicate structural mobility patterns as an important source of triple (dis)advantage for neighborhoods and have implications for a broad range of phenomena beyond crime, including community capacity, gentrification, transmission in a pandemic, and racial inequality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Levy","given":"Brian L."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Nolan E."},{"family":"Sampson","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"levyTripleDisadvantageNeighborhood2020","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/0003122420972323","ISSN":"0003-1224","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,30]]},"language":"en","page":"0003122420972323","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Triple Disadvantage: Neighborhood Networks of Everyday Urban Mobility and Violence in U.S. Cities","title-short":"Triple Disadvantage","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122420972323"},

Recent advances in stochastic actor-based modeling, combined with self-reported data on a popular online social network site, allow us to address this question with a greater degree of precision than has heretofore been possible. Using data on the Facebook activity of a cohort of college students over 4 years, we find that students who share certain tastes in music and in movies, but not in books, are significantly likely to befriend one another. Meanwhile, we find little evidence for the diffusion of tastes among Facebook friends—except for tastes in classical/jazz music.

Betweenness centrality is shown to be an indicator of the interdisciplinarity of journals, but only in local citation environments and after normalization; otherwise, the influence of degree centrality (size) overshadows the betweenness-centrality measure.

Using Rao-Stirling (RS) Diversity sometimes produces anomalous results. We argue that these unexpected outcomes can be related to the use of “dual-concept diversity” which combines “variety” and “balance” in the definitions (ex ante). We propose to modify RS Diversity into a new indicator (DIV) which operationalizes “variety,” “balance,” and “disparity” independently and then combines them ex post. “Balance” can be measured using the Gini coefficient. We apply DIV to the aggregated citation patterns of 11,487 journals covered by the Journal Citation Reports 2016 of the Science Citation Index and the Social Sciences Citation Index as an empirical domain and, in more detail, to the citation patterns of 85 journals assigned to the Web-of-Science category “information science & library science” in both the cited and citing directions. We compare the results of the indicators and show that DIV provides improved results in terms of distinguishing between interdisciplinary knowledge integration (citing references) versus knowledge diffusion (cited impact). The new diversity indicator and RS diversity measure different features.

  {"id":"liCoauthorshipNetworksResearch2013","abstract":"The impact of research work is related to a scholar's reputation and future promotions. Greater research impact not only inspires scholars to continue their research, but also increases the possibility of a larger research budget from sponsors. Given the importance of research impact, this study proposes that utilizing social capital embedded in a social structure is an effective way to achieve more research impact. The contribution of this study is to define six indicators of social capital (degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, prolific co-author count, team exploration, and publishing tenure) and investigate how these indicators interact and affect citations for publications. A total of 137 Information Systems scholars from the Social Science Citation Index database were selected to test the hypothesized relationships. The results show that betweenness centrality plays the most important role in taking advantage of non-redundant resources in a co-authorship network, thereby significantly affecting citations for publications. In addition, we found that prolific co-author count, team exploration, and publishing tenure all have indirect effects on citation count. Specifically, co-authoring with prolific scholars helps researchers develop centralities and, in turn, generate higher numbers of citations. Researchers with longer publishing tenure tend to have higher degree centrality. When they collaborate more with different scholars, they achieve more closeness and betweenness centralities, but risk being distrusted by prolific scholars and losing chances to co-author with them. Finally, implications of findings and recommendations for future research are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Eldon Y."},{"family":"Liao","given":"Chien Hsiang"},{"family":"Yen","given":"Hsiuju Rebecca"}],"citation-key":"liCoauthorshipNetworksResearch2013","container-title":"Research Policy","container-title-short":"Research Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.respol.2013.06.012","ISSN":"0048-7333","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,11]]},"page":"1515-1530","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Co-authorship networks and research impact: A social capital perspective","title-short":"Co-authorship networks and research impact","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733313001169","volume":"42"},

Such early coauthorship predicts a higher probability of repeatedly coauthoring work with top-cited scientists, and, ultimately, a higher probability of becoming one. Junior researchers affiliated with less prestigious institutions show the most benefits from coauthorship with a top scientist.

However it is still a challenging problem that has been addressed only with topological information in recent years. Based on the belief that network nodes with a great number of common neighbors are more likely to be connected, many similarity indices have achieved considerable accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by the natural assumption that the effect of missing links on the estimation of a node’s clustering ability could be related to node degree, in this paper, we propose a degree-related clustering coefficient index to quantify the clustering ability of nodes. Unlike the classical clustering coefficient, our new coefficient is highly robust when the observed bias of links is considered. Furthermore, we propose a degree-related clustering ability path (DCP) index, which applies the proposed coefficient to the link prediction problem. Experiments on 12 real-world networks show that our proposed method is highly accurate and robust compared with four common-neighbor-based similarity indices (Common Neighbors(CN), Adamic-Adar(AA), Resource Allocation(RA), and Preferential Attachment(PA)), and the recently introduced clustering ability (CA) index.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Yangyang"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Chengli"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaojie"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Qiangjuan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xue"},{"family":"Yi","given":"Dongyun"}],"citation-key":"liuDegreerelatedClusteringCoefficient2016","container-title":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","container-title-short":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","DOI":"10.1016/j.physa.2016.02.014","ISSN":"0378-4371","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,15]]},"page":"24-33","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The degree-related clustering coefficient and its application to link prediction","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437116001801","volume":"454"},

  {"id":"liuHotStreaksArtistic2018","abstract":"The hot streak-loosely defined as 'winning begets more winnings'-highlights a specific period during which an individual's performance is substantially better than his or her typical performance. Although hot streaks have been widely debated in sports1,2, gambling3-5 and financial markets6,7 over the past several decades, little is known about whether they apply to individual careers. Here, building on rich literature on the lifecycle of creativity8-22, we collected large-scale career histories of individual artists, film directors and scientists, tracing the artworks, films and scientific publications they produced. We find that, across all three domains, hit works within a career show a high degree of temporal regularity, with each career being characterized by bursts of high-impact works occurring in sequence. We demonstrate that these observations can be explained by a simple hot-streak model, allowing us to probe quantitatively the hot streak phenomenon governing individual careers. We find this phenomemon to be remarkably universal across diverse domains: hot streaks are ubiquitous yet usually unique across different careers. The hot streak emerges randomly within an individual's sequence of works, is temporally localized, and is not associated with any detectable change in productivity. We show that, because works produced during hot streaks garner substantially more impact, the uncovered hot streaks fundamentally drive the collective impact of an individual, and ignoring this leads us to systematically overestimate or underestimate the future impact of a career. These results not only deepen our quantitative understanding of patterns that govern individual ingenuity and success, but also may have implications for identifying and nurturing individuals whose work will have lasting impact.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Lu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Sinatra","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Giles","given":"C.

  {"id":"liuScalingVolatilityBreakouts2013","abstract":"Background\nBecause the movement of stock prices is not only ubiquitous in financial markets but also crucial for investors, extensive studies have been done to understand the law behind it. In particular, since the financial crisis in 2008, researchers have a more interest in investigating large market volatilities in order to grasp changing market trends.\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nIn this work, we analyze the breakouts and breakdowns of both the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US stock market and the Shanghai Composite Index in the Chinese stock market. The breakout usually represents an ongoing upward trend in technical analysis while the breakdown represents an ongoing downward trend. Based on the renormalization method, we introduce two parameters to quantize breakouts and breakdowns, respectively. We discover scaling behavior, characterized by power-law distributions for both the breakouts and breakdowns in the two financial markets with different power-law exponents, which reflect different market volatilities. In detail, the market volatility for breakdowns is usually larger than that for breakouts. Moreover, as an emerging market, the Chinese stock market has larger market volatilities for both the breakouts and breakdowns than the US stock market (a mature market). Further, the short-term volatilities show similar features for both the US stock market and the Chinese stock market. However, the medium-term volatilities in the US stock market are almost symmetrical for the breakouts and breakdowns, whereas those in the Chinese stock market appear to be asymmetrical for the breakouts and breakdowns.\n\nConclusions/Signicance\nThe methodology presented here provides a way to understand scaling and hence volatilities of breakouts and breakdowns in stock price dynamics.

  {"id":"lizardoHowCulturalTastes2006","abstract":"This article examines the relationship between different forms of cultural taste and the density of social contacts across alternative types of network relations classified by average tie strength. The author builds on Bourdieu's ([1986] 2001) classic statement on the “forms of capital” (economic, social, and cultural) and the conversion dynamics among them, and on DiMaggio's (1987) connection between cultural tastes and sociability. He hypothesizes that (1) in addition to cultural tastes being determined by network relations, cultural tastes are used to form and sustain those networks. Furthermore he expects that (2) highbrow culture taste will be less likely to be converted into social capital beyond immediate strong-tie circles due to its more restricted, “assetspecific” nature. Because of its generalized appeal, taste for popular culture will be more likely to be associated with weak-tie network density. The results broadly support these hypotheses: a model that specifies an effect of culture on network density provides a better fit to the data than the traditional conception of networks as determining taste. In addition using log-linear models and instrumental-variable methods, I show that popular culture consumption has a positive impact on weak-tie network density but not strong-tie network density, while highbrow culture consumption selectively increases strong-tie density but has no appreciable effect on weak ties, net of standard socioeconomic variables. These findings help to shed light on the mechanisms that translate mastery of different types of cultural knowledge into integration across distant social positions or closure around strong group boundaries. The author also discusses the implications of the results for current models describing the transformation of cultural into social resources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Lizardo","given":"Omar"}],"citation-key":"lizardoHowCulturalTastes2006","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.1177/000312240607100504","ISSN":"0003-1224, 1939-8271","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"778-807","source":"asr.sagepub.com","title":"How Cultural Tastes Shape Personal Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://asr.sagepub.com/content/71/5/778","volume":"71"},

We present evidence from a variety of domains which demonstrates the prevalence of such projection bias, develop a formal model of it, and use this model to demonstrate its importance in economic environments. We show that, when people exhibit habit formation, projection bias leads people to consume too much early in life, and to decide, as time passes, to consume more-and save less-than originally planned.

  {"id":"loewensteinRiskFeelings2001","abstract":"Virtually all current theories of choice under risk or uncertainty are cognitive and consequentialist. They assume that people assess the desirability and likelihood of possible outcomes of choice alternatives and integrate this information through some type of expectation-based calculus to arrive at a decision. The authors propose an alternative theoretical perspective, the risk-as-feelings hypothesis, that highlights the role of affect experienced at the moment of decision making. Drawing on research from clinical, physiological, and other subfields of psychology, they show that emotional reactions to risky situations often diverge from cognitive assessments of those risks. When such divergence occurs, emotional reactions often drive behavior. The risk-as-feelings hypothesis is shown to explain a wide range of phenomena that have resisted interpretation in cognitive–consequentialist terms.","author":[{"family":"Loewenstein","given":"George F."},{"family":"Weber","given":"Elke U."},{"family":"Hsee","given":"Christopher K."},{"family":"Welch","given":"Ned"}],"citation-key":"loewensteinRiskFeelings2001","container-title":"Psychological Bulletin","DOI":"10.1037/0033-2909.127.2.267","ISSN":"1939-1455(Electronic);0033-2909(Print)","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"page":"267-286","source":"APA PsycNET","title":"Risk as feelings","type":"article-journal","volume":"127"},

Yet the research drawing on vocabularies is wide ranging and not integrated. We review work on vocabularies from literatures on rhetoric, culture, cognition, and coordination. We integrate and extend this work on vocabularies, introducing the new concept of vocabulary structure to capture different aspects of vocabulary use that collectively explain how vocabularies yield meaningful categories. We also generate a cross-level model to link work on vocabularies at the level of social collectives with work on vocabulary use in situations. We illustrate the usefulness of vocabularies by showing how they help advance work on institutional logics.

  {"id":"loIdeologicalClarityMultiparty2016","abstract":"Parties in advanced democracies take ideological positions as part of electoral competition, but some parties communicate their position more clearly than others. Existing research on democratic party competition has paid much attention to assessing partisan position taking in electoral manifestos, but it has largely overlooked how manifestos reflect the clarity of these positions. This article presents a scaling procedure that better reflects the data-generating process of party manifestos. This new estimator allows us to recover not only positional estimates, but also estimates for the ideological clarity or ambiguity of parties. The study validates its results using Monte Carlo tests, a manifesto-drafting simulation and a human coding exercise. Finally, the article applies the estimator to party manifestos in four multiparty democracies and demonstrates that ambiguity can enhance the appeal of parties with platforms that become more moderate, and lessen the appeal of parties with platforms that become more extreme.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Lo","given":"James"},{"family":"Proksch","given":"Sven-Oliver"},{"family":"Slapin","given":"Jonathan B."}],"citation-key":"loIdeologicalClarityMultiparty2016","container-title":"British Journal of Political Science","DOI":"10.1017/S0007123414000192","ISSN":"0007-1234, 1469-2112","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7]]},"page":"591-610","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Ideological Clarity in Multiparty Competition: A New Measure and Test Using Election Manifestos","title-short":"Ideological Clarity in Multiparty Competition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/ideological-clarity-in-multiparty-competition-a-new-measure-and-test-using-election-manifestos/5F1C1BA017439ACF0DD879D09AC7D7AD","volume":"46"},

  {"id":"longUsingHeteroscedasticityConsistent2000","abstract":"In the presence of heteroscedasticity, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates are unbiased, but the usual tests of significance are generally inappropriate and their use can lead to incorrect inferences. Tests based on a heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix (HCCM), however, are consistent even in the presence of heteroscedasticity of an unknown form. Most applications that use a HCCM appear to rely on the asymptotic version known as HC0. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that HC0 often results in incorrect inferences when N ≤ 250, while three relatively unknown, small sample versions of the HCCM, and especially a version known as HC3, work well even for N's as small as 25. We recommend that: (1) data analysts should correct for heteroscedasticity using a HCCM whenever there is reason to suspect heteroscedasticity; (2) the decision to use HCCM-based tests should not be determined by a screening test for heteroscedasticity; and (3) when N ≤ 250, the HCCM known as HC3 should be used. Since HC3 is simple to compute, we encourage authors of statistical software to add this estimator to their programs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,12,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Long","given":"J.

  {"id":"loughranReturnsCriminalCapital2013","abstract":"Human capital theory posits that individuals increase their labor market returns through investments in education and training. This concept has been studied extensively across several disciplines. An analog concept of criminal capital, the focus of some speculation and limited empirical study, remains considerably less developed theoretically and methodologically. This article offers a formal theoretical model of criminal capital indicators and tests for greater illegal wage returns using a sample of serious adolescent offenders, many of whom participate in illegal income-generating activities. Our results reveal that, consistent with human capital theory, important illegal wage premiums are associated with investments in criminal capital, notably an increasing but declining marginal return to experience and a premium for specialization. Furthermore, as in studies of legal labor markets, we find strong evidence that, if left unaccounted for, nonrandom sample selection causes severe bias in models of illegal wages. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of these results, along with directions for future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Loughran","given":"Thomas A."},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Holly"},{"family":"Piquero","given":"Alex R."},{"family":"Fagan","given":"Jeffrey"}],"citation-key":"loughranReturnsCriminalCapital2013","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.1177/0003122413505588","ISSN":"0003-1224, 1939-8271","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"925-948","source":"asr.sagepub.com","title":"The Returns to Criminal Capital","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://asr.sagepub.com/content/78/6/925","volume":"78"},

This graduate and practitioner guide, first published in 2000, deals with the study and prediction of consumer choice behaviour, concentrating on stated preference (SP) methods - placing decision makers in controlled experiments that yield hypothetical choices - rather than revealed preferences (RP) - actual choices in the market. It shows how SP methods can be implemented, from experimental design to econometric modelling, and suggests how to combine RP and SP data to get the best from each type.

  {"id":"luhmannSocialSystems1995","abstract":"A major challenge confronting contemporary theory is to overcome its fixation on written narratives and the culture of print. In this presentation of a general theory of systems, Germany&#39;s most prominent and controversial social thinker sets out a contribution to sociology that reworks our understanding of meaning and communication.  Luhmann concedes that there is no longer a binding representation of society within society, but refuses to describe this situation as a loss of legitimation or a crisis of representation. Instead, he proposes that we search for new ways of coping with the enforced selectivity that marks any self-description under the conditions of functionally differentiated modern society. For Luhmann, the end of metanarratives does not mean the end of theory, but a challenge to theory, an invitation to open itself to theoretical developments in a number of disciplines that, for quite some time, have been successfully working with cybernetic models that no longer require the fiction of the external observer.  Social Systems provides the foundation for a theory of modern society that would be congruent with this new understanding of the world. One of the most important contributions to social theory of recent decades, it has implications for many disciplines beyond sociology.","author":[{"family":"Luhmann","given":"Niklas"}],"citation-key":"luhmannSocialSystems1995","event-place":"Stanford","ISBN":"978-0-8047-2625-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"692","publisher":"Stanford University Press","publisher-place":"Stanford","source":"Google Books","title":"Social Systems","type":"book"},

Our framework draws on theory and research on information processing, social categorization, coordination, and homophily to posit the influence of cognitive, gender, and country diversity on innovation. Our longitudinal model is based on a unique data set of 1,354 researchers who helped create the new scientific field of oncofertility, by collaborating on 469 publications over a 4-year period. We capture the differences among researchers along cognitive, country, and gender dimensions, as well as examine how the resulting diversity or homophily influences the formation of collaborative innovation networks. We find that innovation, operationalized as publishing in a new scientific discipline, benefits from both homophily and diversity. Homophily in country of residence and working with prior collaborators help reduce uncertainty in the interactions associated with innovation, while diversity in knowledge enables the recombinant knowledge required for innovation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Lungeanu","given":"Alina"},{"family":"Contractor","given":"Noshir S."}],"citation-key":"lungeanuEffectsDiversityNetwork2015","container-title":"American Behavioral Scientist","container-title-short":"American Behavioral Scientist","DOI":"10.1177/0002764214556804","ISSN":"0002-7642, 1552-3381","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"548-564","source":"abs.sagepub.com","title":"The Effects of Diversity and Network Ties on Innovations The Emergence of a New Scientific Field","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://abs.sagepub.com/content/59/5/548","volume":"59"},

  {"id":"lusardiEconomicImportanceFinancial2014","abstract":"This paper undertakes an assessment of a rapidly growing body of economic research on financial literacy. We start with an overview of theoretical research, which casts financial knowledge as a form of investment in human capital. Endogenizing financial knowledge has important implications for welfare, as well as policies intended to enhance levels of financial knowledge in the larger population. Next, we draw on recent surveys to establish how much (or how little) people know and identify the least financially savvy population subgroups. This is followed by an examination of the impact of financial literacy on economic decision making in the United States and elsewhere. While the literature is still young, conclusions may be drawn about the effects and consequences of financial illiteracy and what works to remedy these gaps. A final section offers thoughts on what remains to be learned if researchers are to better inform theoretical and empirical models as well as public policy.","author":[{"family":"Lusardi","given":"Annamaria"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Olivia S."}],"citation-key":"lusardiEconomicImportanceFinancial2014","container-title":"Journal of Economic Literature","container-title-short":"Journal of Economic Literature","DOI":"10.1257/jel.52.1.5","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,3,1]]},"page":"5-44","source":"IngentaConnect","title":"The Economic Importance of Financial Literacy: Theory and Evidence","title-short":"The Economic Importance of Financial Literacy","type":"article-journal","volume":"52"},

  {"id":"lutterWhoBecomesTenured2016","abstract":"Prior studies that try to explain who gets tenure and why remain inconclusive, especially on whether non-meritocratic factors influence who becomes a professor. Based on career and publication data of virtually all sociologists working in German sociology departments, we test how meritocratic factors (academic productivity) as well as non-meritocratic factors (ascription, symbolic and social capital) influence the chances of getting a permanent professorship in sociology. Our findings show that getting tenure in sociology is strongly related to scholarly output, as previous studies have shown. Improving on existing studies, however, we show specifically that each refereed journal article and each monograph increases a sociologist's chance for tenure by 10 to 15 percent, while other publications affect odds for tenure only marginally and in some cases even negatively. Regarding non-meritocratic factors, we show that network size, individual reputation, and gender matters. Women get their first permanent position as university professor with on average 23 to 44 percent fewer publications than men; all else being equal, they are about 1.4 times more likely to get tenure than men. The article generally contributes to a better understanding of the role of meritocratic and non-meritocratic factors in achieving scarce and highly competitive job positions in academia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Lutter","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Schröder","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"lutterWhoBecomesTenured2016","container-title":"Research Policy","container-title-short":"Research Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.respol.2016.01.019","ISSN":"0048-7333","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,1]]},"page":"999-1013","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Who becomes a tenured professor, and why?

  {"id":"lutzFinanzmarkte2008","abstract":"Auf Finanzmärkten werden weder Güter produziert noch Produkte zum Zwecke des Konsums an Kunden verteilt. Vielmehr dienen Finanzmärkte dem Handel von Kapital in Form von Geld (Währungen), Wertpapieren (Aktien, Anleihen) oder anderen Finanzkontrakten (Derivate). Im Unterschied zu Transaktionen auf Gütermärkten ist der Handel auf Finanzmärkten zukunftsorientiert, denn es werden Zahlungsversprechen gehandelt (vgl. Windolf 2005: 27). Ein Kapitalgeber (z. B. Investor) überlässt dem Kapitalnehmer (z. B. Unternehmen) Zahlungsmittel und erhält im Gegenzug ein Rückzahlungsversprechen für die Zukunft (z. B. Aussicht auf Dividende für eine Aktie). Eine solche Transaktion hat zwei Merkmale: zum einen wird die zeitliche Diskrepanz zwischen der Verfügbarkeit und dem Verwendungswunsch von Kapital überbrückt. Ein Marktteilnehmer verzichtet heute auf Zahlungsmittel, ein anderer verspricht, diese in Zukunft zurückzuzahlen (intertemporale Allokation). Zweitens werden Kontrakte über Zahlungsversprechen meist unter dem Aspekt des Risikotransfers abgeschlossen (vgl. Jäger 2006: 12 ff.). Dies gilt insbesondere für komplexere Finanzprodukte wie Derivate (Optionen, Futures), bei denen zum Zeitpunkt des Abschlusses des Kontraktes keine Zahlung fällig wird, sondern erst in der Zukunft. Derartige Termingeschäfte mit Aktien, Anleihen, Währungen, Metallen oder Waren entwickelten sich ursprünglich aus dem Bemühen, Einkommen aus dem Handel mit Gütern abzusichern, deren Preise stark schwanken oder deren Herstellung zeitaufwendig ist. Produzenten und Verkäufer wollen sich gegen das Risiko absichern, dass die Preise zwischen Beginn und Ende der Produktion sinken, Einkäufer möchten sich vor unerwarteten Preissteigerungen schützen.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Lütz","given":"Susanne"}],"citation-key":"lutzFinanzmarkte2008","container-title":"Handbuch der Wirtschaftssoziologie","editor":[{"family":"Maurer","given":"Andrea"}],"event-place":"Wiesbaden","ISBN":"978-3-531-15259-2 978-3-531-90905-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,1,1]]},"language":"de","page":"341-360","publisher":"VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften","publisher-place":"Wiesbaden","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Finanzmärkte","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-531-90905-9_17"},

This was a follow-up study of a probability sample of the adult household residents of East Baltimore. The analyses included 1,318 participants in the Baltimore, Maryland, portion of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study who completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) during three study waves in 1981, 1982, and 1993–1996. Individual MMSE score differences between waves 2 and 3 were calculated for each study participant. After 12 years, study participants' scores declined a mean of 1.20 points on the MMSE (standard deviation 1.90), with 66% having scores that declined by at least one point. Significant numbers of scores declined by three points or more (15% of participants in the 18–29 age group). There were no significant differences in cognitive decline between heavy users, light users, and nonusers of cannabis. There were also no male-female differences in cognitive decline in relation to cannabis use. The authors conclude that over long time periods, in persons under age 65 years, cognitive decline occurs in all age groups. This decline is closely associated with aging and educational level but does not appear to be associated with cannabis use.

  {"id":"mackenzieEconomistsMakeMarkets2007","abstract":"Around the globe, economists affect markets by saying what markets are doing, what they should do, and what they will do. Increasingly, experimental economists are even designing real-world markets. But, despite these facts, economists are still largely thought of as scientists who merely observe markets from the outside, like astronomers look at the stars. Do Economists Make Markets? boldly challenges this view. It is the first book dedicated to the controversial question of whether economics is performative--of whether, in some cases, economics actually produces the phenomena it analyzes.The book's case studies--including financial derivatives markets, telecommunications-frequency auctions, and individual transferable quotas in fisheries--give substance to the notion of the performativity of economics in an accessible, nontechnical way. Some chapters defend the notion; others attack it vigorously. The book ends with an extended chapter in which Michel Callon, the idea's main formulator, reflects upon the debate and asks what it means to say economics is performative.The book's insights and strong claims about the ways economics is entangled with the markets it studies should interest--and provoke--economic sociologists, economists, and other social scientists.In addition to the editors and Callon, the contributors include Marie-France Garcia-Parpet, Francesco Guala, Emmanuel Didier, Philip Mirowski, Edward Nik-Khah, Petter Holm, Vincent-Antonin Lépinay, and Timothy Mitchell.","author":[{"family":"MacKenzie","given":"Donald"},{"family":"Muniesa","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Siu","given":"Lucia"}],"citation-key":"mackenzieEconomistsMakeMarkets2007","event-place":"Princeton, NY","ISBN":"978-0-691-13016-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,7,2]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"396","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton, NY","source":"Google Books","title":"Do Economists Make Markets?: On the Performativity of Economics","title-short":"Do Economists Make Markets?","type":"book"},

The degrees of the vertices in the collaboration graph follow a “Power law” pattern i.e., the number of vertices of degree x is proportional to a negative power of x. The clustering coefficient of collaboration graph comes out to be very high which means that there are more chances for two authors to co-author a paper if they have a common collaborator. We also found that the collaboration graph follows various real graph properties like WPL (Weight power law), DPL (Densification power law) etc. We try to apply the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient on the collaboration graph to study the variation in concentration of collaboration between researchers with time.","author":[{"family":"Madaan","given":"Gaurav"},{"family":"Jolad","given":"Shivakumar"}],"citation-key":"madaanEvolutionScientificCollaboration2014","container-title":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","DOI":"10.1109/BigData.2014.7004346","event":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,10]]},"page":"7-13","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Evolution of scientific collaboration networks","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"magubaneAmericanSociologyRacial2016","abstract":"Standard American disciplinary history holds that the ‘founding fathers’, inspired by ‘great men theorizing European modernity’, created a sister discipline in Europe’s image. This article proposes an alternative history, which locates the founding of American sociology in the writings of ‘pro-slavery imperialists’ Henry Hughes and George Fitzhugh. A methodologically nationalistic sociology of ‘race relations’, which isolates the study of race from issues of ‘general’ sociological concern, has substituted for sustained engagement with sociology’s colonialist and imperialist past. Racism has been made an anachronistic survivor in tradition, rather than a constitutive part of modernity. Rehabilitating this lost history is therefore vital for creating a new, global historical sociology, as is questioning the conceptual matrix that isolates the study of race and racism from issues of general sociological concern.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Magubane","given":"Zine"}],"citation-key":"magubaneAmericanSociologyRacial2016","container-title":"Cultural Sociology","container-title-short":"Cultural Sociology","DOI":"10.1177/1749975516641301","ISSN":"1749-9755","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"369-384","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"American Sociology’s Racial Ontology: Remembering Slavery, Deconstructing Modernity, and Charting the Future of Global Historical Sociology","title-short":"American Sociology’s Racial Ontology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1749975516641301","volume":"10"},

Consistent with previous research, the results reveal that student homogeneity is positively related to social interaction in schools but that these relationships are not always straightforward with regard to socioeconomic status. Students’ experiences in socioeconomically diverse environments depend on their relative positions within the distribution, even when holding the percentage of same–socioeconomic status peers constant. Although few factors are associated with more diverse friendship preferences—save potentially participation in the arts—factors that increase the overall likelihood of friendship tie formation predict higher numbers of intergroup friends.

  {"id":"maMentorshipProtegeSuccess2020","abstract":"<p>Einstein believed that mentors are especially influential in a protégé’s intellectual development, yet the link between mentorship and protégé success remains a mystery. We marshaled genealogical data on nearly 40,000 scientists who published 1,167,518 papers in biomedicine, chemistry, math, or physics between 1960 and 2017 to investigate the relationship between mentorship and protégé achievement. In our data, we find groupings of mentors with similar records and reputations who attracted protégés of similar talents and expected levels of professional success. However, each grouping has an exception: One mentor has an additional hidden capability that can be mentored to their protégés. They display skill in creating and communicating prizewinning research. Because the mentor’s ability for creating and communicating celebrated research existed before the prize’s conferment, protégés of future prizewinning mentors can be uniquely exposed to mentorship for conducting celebrated research. Our models explain 34–44% of the variance in protégé success and reveals three main findings. First, mentorship strongly predicts protégé success across diverse disciplines. Mentorship is associated with a 2×-to-4× rise in a protégé’s likelihood of prizewinning, National Academy of Science (NAS) induction, or superstardom relative to matched protégés. Second, mentorship is significantly associated with an increase in the probability of protégés pioneering their own research topics and being midcareer late bloomers. Third, contrary to conventional thought, protégés do not succeed most by following their mentors’ research topics but by studying original topics and coauthoring no more than a small fraction of papers with their mentors.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Ma","given":"Yifang"},{"family":"Mukherjee","given":"Satyam"},{"family":"Uzzi","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"maMentorshipProtegeSuccess2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1915516117","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,10]]},"language":"en","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Mentorship and protégé success in STEM fields","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/06/02/1915516117"},

First, we examine neighborhoods that are harsh on children’s development: those characterized by high levels of violence, incarceration, and lead exposure. Second, we examine potential supportive or offsetting mechanisms that promote children’s development, such as informal social control, cohesion among neighbors, and organizational participation. Census tract mobility estimates from linked income tax and Census records are merged with surveys and administrative records in Chicago. We find that exposure to neighborhood violence, incarceration, and lead combine to independently predict poor black boys’ later incarceration as adults and lower income rank relative to their parents, and poor black girls’ teenage motherhood. Features of neighborhood social organization matter less, but are selectively important. Results for poor whites also show that toxic environments independently predict lower social mobility, as do features of social organization, to a lesser extent. Overall, our measures contribute a 76% relative increase in explained variance for black male incarceration beyond that of concentrated poverty and other standard characteristics, an 18% increase for black male income rank (70% for whites), and a 17% increase for teenage motherhood of black girls (40% for whites).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Manduca","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Sampson","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"manducaPunishingToxicNeighborhood2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1820464116","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,16]]},"language":"en","page":"7772-7777","PMID":"30936309","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Social Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Punishing and toxic neighborhood environments independently predict the intergenerational social mobility of black and white children","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/16/7772","volume":"116"},

Due to the steady increase in the number of scientific publications, it is hard to keep an overview of the structure and dynamic development of one's own field of science, much less all scientific domains. However, knowledge of “hot” topics, emergent research frontiers, or change of focus in certain areas is a critical component of resource allocation decisions in research laboratories, governmental institutions, and corporations. This paper demonstrates the utilization of Kleinberg's burst detection algorithm, co-word occurrence analysis, and graph layout techniques to generate maps that support the identification of major research topics and trends.

All four actually impact differently on nationstates in different regions, contain both state-weakening and strengthening tendencies, and increase the significance of inter-national as well as transnational networks. Capitalist transformation is slightly weakening the nation-states of the north (most clearly so within the EU), yet economic development would strengthen southern nation-states. The decline of 'hard geopolitics' in a post-nuclear age weakens northern, but not most southern, states. Yet 'soft geopolitics' is everywhere bringing new state functions and maintaining the strength of inter-national networks. Identity politics, contrary to most views, probably strengthens nationally bound politics. These patterns are too varied to permit us to argue simply either that the nation-state and the nation-state system are strengthening or weakening.

This study investigated community and family factors that influence school efforts to reduce odds of group bullying behavior and victimization. METHODS We used multilevel logistic regression to analyze data from the 2009 Youth in Iceland population school survey (N = 7084, response rate: 83.5%, 50.8% girls). RESULTS Parental support and time spent with parents were protective against group bullying behavior while worsening relationships with teachers and disliking school increased the likelihood of such behavior. Knowing kids in the area increased the likelihood of group bullying while intergenerational closure was a protective factor. Normlessness was consistently positively related to group bullying. We found no indication of higher-level relationships across the bullying models. Parental support was protective against victimization. Disliking school, intergenerational closure, and anomie/normlessness were strongly and negatively related to victimization. We found some indication of multilevel relationships for victimization. CONCLUSIONS Findings support efforts to increase family and community connection, closure, and support as a part of school-based intervention.

  {"id":"maozNetworksNationsEvolution2010","abstract":"In this book, Zeev Maoz offers a new theory of networked international politics. Maoz views the evolution of international relations over the last two centuries as a set of interacting, cooperative, and conflicting networks of states. The networks that emerged are the result of national choice processes about forming or breaking ties with other states. States are constantly concerned with their security and survival in an anarchic world. Their security concerns stem from their external environment and their past conflicts. Because many of them cannot ensure their security by their own power, they need allies to balance against a hostile international environment. The alliance choices made by states define the structure of security cooperation networks and spill over into other cooperative networks, including trade and institutions. Maoz tests his theory by applying social networks analysis (SNA) methods to international relations. He offers a novel perspective on the study of international relations as a system of interrelated networks that co-evolve and interact with one another.","author":[{"family":"Maoz","given":"Zeev"}],"citation-key":"maozNetworksNationsEvolution2010","event-place":"Cambridge ; New York","ISBN":"978-0-521-12457-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,12,6]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"448","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge ; New York","source":"Amazon","title":"Networks of Nations: The Evolution, Structure, and Impact of International Networks, 1816-2001","title-short":"Networks of Nations","type":"book"},

That there should be a spread of life expectancy of 48 years among countries and 20 years or more within countries is not inevitable. A burgeoning volume of research identifies social factors at the root of much of these inequalities in health. Social determinants are relevant to communicable and non-communicable disease alike. Health status, therefore, should be of concern to policy makers in every sector, not solely those involved in health policy. As a response to this global challenge, WHO is launching a Commission on Social Determinants of Health, which will review the evidence, raise societal debate, and recommend policies with the goal of improving health of the world's most vulnerable people. A major thrust of the Commission is turning public-health knowledge into political action.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Marmot","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"marmotSocialDeterminantsHealth2005","container-title":"The Lancet","container-title-short":"The Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(05)71146-6","ISSN":"0140-6736","issue":"9464","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,3,25]]},"page":"1099-1104","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Social determinants of health inequalities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673605711466","volume":"365"},

  {"id":"marschallParlamentMediengesellschaftVerschrankungen2001","abstract":"The assumed decline of parliaments’ power in the political decision making process is blamed on a complex social and political transformation. Among others, changes in the structures of the public space, especially the emergence of mass communication, represent a crucial challenge for parliamentary representation. Parliaments depend on a functioning external communication, since their relations to the public are a central source of parliamentary legitimacy and power. In two fields one can observe an evident overlapping between the systems of parliament and mass media: in parliament’s management of communication and in parliament’s procedures of opinion forming and decision making. In a case study of the German Bundestag, processes of adaptation to the structures of the mass media system can be found in these areas. Adaptation comes to its limits where it collides with the necessity to provide space for bargaining processes. Furthermore, the processes of adaptation illustrate how political actors realize and structurally actualize the ambigious relationship between publicity and power.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Marschall","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"marschallParlamentMediengesellschaftVerschrankungen2001","container-title":"Politische Vierteljahresschrift","container-title-short":"PVS","DOI":"10.1007/s11615-001-0072-3","ISSN":"0032-3470, 1862-2860","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,9]]},"language":"de","page":"388-413","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Das Parlament in der Mediengesellschaft — Verschränkungen zwischen parlamentarischer und massenmedialer Arena","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-001-0072-3","volume":"42"},

  {"id":"marshallDefiningPopulationProblems2013","abstract":"The content of academic journals provides insight into disciplinary boundaries and priorities. This paper uses correlated topic modeling (CTM), an innovative approach to textual analysis, for a cross-national comparison of the development of research agendas in the discipline of demography. Using articles from leading demographic journals from 1946 to 2005, CTM shows how the set of concepts relevant to the study of fertility was defined differently in France and Great Britain. Results indicate that demographic research agendas reflected both cultural and institutional differences that shaped different understandings of fertility decline. While British demography focused on high-fertility contexts, French demography focused on lower-fertility contexts. This difference reflects national intellectual traditions shaped by larger cultural discourses: the dominance of demographic transition theory and fears of overpopulation in Britain versus the co-existence in France of a second salient model, a theory of demographic “revolution” with sustained low fertility leading to depopulation. Relationships between expert concerns and broader public concerns are then examined in the British case by comparing journal publications to mass-media coverage of fertility and population issues. This comparison shows that British academic demography passed over some policy-relevant population issues, such as discussions of immigrant fertility, that were featured in the popular press.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Marshall","given":"Emily A."}],"citation-key":"marshallDefiningPopulationProblems2013","collection-title":"Topic Models and the Cultural Sciences","container-title":"Poetics","container-title-short":"Poetics","DOI":"10.1016/j.poetic.2013.08.001","ISSN":"0304-422X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"701-724","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Defining population problems: Using topic models for cross-national comparison of disciplinary development","title-short":"Defining population problems","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X13000570","volume":"41"},

Our research questions concern: (1) whether there is overlap in the information obtained from each source and (2) how the three information acquisition-extraction strategies employed can inform one another. This research project uses network text analysis as a framework for a mixed method approach to knowledge discovery. We show that concepts as well as the network structure of information obtained from interviews may be almost completely covered by networks representing the information extracted from a large number of news articles from a wide variety of sources, while the information overlap of interviews with article keywords was less straightforward. We also show how a conceptual network constructed from a small number of interviews can be used in a semantic pattern search that localizes interview topics in a larger network of news article topics. This approach thus uses newspaper articles to frame and elaborate the narratives of interviews in a larger cultural context.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Martin","given":"Michael K."},{"family":"Pfeffer","given":"Juergen"},{"family":"Carley","given":"Kathleen M."}],"citation-key":"martinNetworkTextAnalysis2013","container-title":"Social Network Analysis and Mining","container-title-short":"Soc.

This so-called “framing effect” represents a striking violation of standard economic accounts of human rationality, although its underlying neurobiology is not understood. We found that the framing effect was specifically associated with amygdala activity, suggesting a key role for an emotional system in mediating decision biases. Moreover, across individuals, orbital and medial prefrontal cortex activity predicted a reduced susceptibility to the framing effect. This finding highlights the importance of incorporating emotional processes within models of human choice and suggests how the brain may modulate the effect of these biasing influences to approximate rationality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Martino","given":"Benedetto De"},{"family":"Kumaran","given":"Dharshan"},{"family":"Seymour","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Dolan","given":"Raymond J."}],"citation-key":"martinoFramesBiasesRational2006","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.1128356","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"5787","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,8,4]]},"language":"en","page":"684-687","PMID":"16888142","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"Frames, Biases, and Rational Decision-Making in the Human Brain","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5787/684","volume":"313"},
  {"id":"martinOtherSideValues2020","abstract":"The concept of values is currently enjoying renewed interest in sociology; indeed, many claim that it must be treated as central to any theory of action. As introduced to American sociology from Europe by Parsons, it was transformed from a condition of possibility into an intrinsic element of the action system that could link abstract cultural imperatives to patterns of concrete behavior. When Parsons’s system dissolved, the notion of values fractured, some scholars treating values as abstract imperatives and others as behavior patterns, but they foundered on issues of the separation of validity and existence. Subtracting the notion of validity from values returns us to the concept of interests, dyadic relations between actors and objects characterized by intention, attention, and extension—in other words, investment of self. This notion of interests lacks the explanatory instability characteristic of that of values. Recasting discussions of values in terms of interests can clarify issues central to our discipline.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Martin","given":"John Levi"},{"family":"Lembo","given":"Alessandra"}],"citation-key":"martinOtherSideValues2020","container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","container-title-short":"American Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1086/709778","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,1]]},"page":"52-98","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"On the Other Side of Values","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/709778","volume":"126"},

Position in the field indicates the potential for a force exerted on the person, but a force that impinges “from the inside” as opposed to external compulsion. Motivation is accordingly considered to be the paramount example of social structure in action, as opposed to a residue of chance or freedom. While field theory is often castigated for its necessarily tautological definition, this may be far more of an advantage than a defect. Field theory offers social scientists a combination of analytical insight and attention to the concrete; further, the implicit definition of “explanation” that it brings is one that, unlike conventional sociological definitions, is internally consistent and in accord with everyday usage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Martin","given":"John Levi"}],"citation-key":"martinWhatFieldTheory2003","container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","container-title-short":"American Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1086/375201","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,7,1]]},"note":"ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: July 2003 / Copyright © 2003 The University of Chicago Press","page":"1-49","source":"JSTOR","title":"What Is Field Theory?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/375201","volume":"109"},

  {"id":"matterPvsROpenSource2015","abstract":"Digital data from the political sphere is abundant, omnipresent, and more and more directly accessible through the Internet. Project Vote Smart (PVS) is a prominent example of this big public data and covers various aspects of U.S. politics in astonishing detail. Despite the vast potential of PVS’ data for political science, economics, and sociology, it is hardly used in empirical research. The systematic compilation of semi-structured data can be complicated and time consuming as the data format is not designed for conventional scientific research. This paper presents a new tool that makes the data easily accessible to a broad scientific community. We provide the software called pvsR as an add-on to the R programming environment for statistical computing. This open source interface (OSI) serves as a direct link between a statistical analysis and the large PVS database. The free and open code is expected to substantially reduce the cost of research with PVS’ new big public data in a vast variety of possible applications. We discuss its advantages vis-à-vis traditional methods of data generation as well as already existing interfaces. The validity of the library is documented based on an illustration involving female representation in local politics. In addition, pvsR facilitates the replication of research with PVS data at low costs, including the pre-processing of data. Similar OSIs are recommended for other big public databases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Matter","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Stutzer","given":"Alois"}],"citation-key":"matterPvsROpenSource2015","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0130501","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,1]]},"page":"e0130501","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"pvsR: An Open Source Interface to Big Data on the American Political Sphere","title-short":"pvsR","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0130501","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"maxwellPerceivedThreatCrime2019","abstract":"President Duterte of the Philippines implemented an open “war” on drugs based upon claims of an over-proliferation of illegal drugs in the country. Despite summary killings of suspected users and dealers, Duterte enjoys popular support among Filipinos. This paper assesses reasons behind the support using citizens’ perceptions of the severity of the drugs/crime problem, their punitiveness, and authoritarian attitudes as explanations. A sample of 114 Filipinos across Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao responded to an electronic survey about socio-legal issues. Results show that drugs/crime are perceived as serious problems nationally yet only minor problems locally. This perceived national seriousness is significantly related to support for Duterte. Trust in the law and enforcement agents, an authoritarian attitude, and region are also strongly related to support for Duterte. This paper concludes with reflections on information manipulation as means to advance political ends and the importance of context in furthering theories of authoritarian submission.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Maxwell","given":"Sheila Royo"}],"citation-key":"maxwellPerceivedThreatCrime2019","container-title":"International Journal of Comparative and Applied Criminal Justice","DOI":"10.1080/01924036.2018.1558084","ISSN":"0192-4036","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,3]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/01924036.2018.1558084","page":"207-218","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Perceived threat of crime, authoritarianism, and the rise of a populist president in the Philippines","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01924036.2018.1558084","volume":"43"},

We randomly selected a sample of 238 authors from the Web of Science, calculated their h-index as well as the h-index of all co-authors from their h-index articles, and calculated an adjacency matrix where the relation between co-authors is the number of articles they published together. Our model was highly predictive of the variability in the h-index (R 2 = 0.69). Most of the variance was explained by number of co-authors. Other significant variables were those associated with highly productive co-authors. Contrary to our hypothesis, network structure as measured by components was not predictive. This analysis suggests that the highest h-index will be achieved by working with many co-authors, at least some with high h-indexes themselves.

Some are rank-ordered caste systems and others are flat, cliquish worlds. Explaining the source of such structural variation remains a challenge, however, because global network features are generally treated as the agglomeration of micro-level tie-formation mechanisms, namely balance, homophily, and dominance. How do the same micro-mechanisms generate significant variation in global network structures? To answer this question we propose and test a network ecological theory that specifies the ways features of organizational environments moderate the expression of tie-formation processes, thereby generating variability in global network structures across settings. We develop this argument using longitudinal friendship data on schools (Add Health study) and classrooms (Classroom Engagement study), and by extending exponential random graph models to the study of multiple societies over time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"McFarland","given":"Daniel A."},{"family":"Moody","given":"James"},{"family":"Diehl","given":"David"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Jeffrey A."},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Reuben J."}],"citation-key":"mcfarlandNetworkEcologyAdolescent2014","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.1177/0003122414554001","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1088-1121","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Network Ecology and Adolescent Social Structure","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0003122414554001","volume":"79"},

These data have created demand for new methods that reduce/simplify the dimensionality of data, identify novel patterns and relations, and predict outcomes, from computational ethnography and computational linguistics to network science, machine learning, and in situ experiments. Such developments have led scholars to begin new lines of social inquiry. Company engineers, computer scientists, and social scientists have all converged on big data, creating the possibility of a vibrant “trading zone” for collaboration. However, strong differences in research frameworks help explain why big data may not be an egalitarian trading zone across fields, but rather—at least in the short term—a moment when engineering colonizes sociology more than vice versa.

From the initial concept of an idea through production, distribution and finally exhibition there are many aspects to the film project and the film industry that present new and interesting puzzles worthy of investigation.

  {"id":"mckeownPredictingImpactScientific2016","abstract":"New scientific concepts, interpreted broadly, are continuously introduced in the literature, but relatively few concepts have a long-term impact on society. The identification of such concepts is a challenging prediction task that would help multiple parties—including researchers and the general public—focus their attention within the vast scientific literature. In this paper we present a system that predicts the future impact of a scientific concept, represented as a technical term, based on the information available from recently published research articles. We analyze the usefulness of rich features derived from the full text of the articles through a variety of approaches, including rhetorical sentence analysis, information extraction, and time-series analysis. The results from two large-scale experiments with 3.8 million full-text articles and 48 million metadata records support the conclusion that full-text features are significantly more useful for prediction than metadata-only features and that the most accurate predictions result from combining the metadata and full-text features. Surprisingly, these results hold even when the metadata features are available for a much larger number of documents than are available for the full-text features.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"McKeown","given":"Kathy"},{"family":"Daume","given":"Hal"},{"family":"Chaturvedi","given":"Snigdha"},{"family":"Paparrizos","given":"John"},{"family":"Thadani","given":"Kapil"},{"family":"Barrio","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Biran","given":"Or"},{"family":"Bothe","given":"Suvarna"},{"family":"Collins","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Fleischmann","given":"Kenneth R."},{"family":"Gravano","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Jha","given":"Rahul"},{"family":"King","given":"Ben"},{"family":"McInerney","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Moon","given":"Taesun"},{"family":"Neelakantan","given":"Arvind"},{"family":"O'Seaghdha","given":"Diarmuid"},{"family":"Radev","given":"Dragomir"},{"family":"Templeton","given":"Clay"},{"family":"Teufel","given":"Simone"}],"citation-key":"mckeownPredictingImpactScientific2016","container-title":"Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology","DOI":"10.1002/asi.23612","ISSN":"2330-1643","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2684-2696","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Predicting the impact of scientific concepts using full-text features","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.23612","volume":"67"},

Although institutional and sociological explanations of single-issue party strength have been dominant, they tend to remove parties from the analysis. In this article, I argue that the behavior of mainstream parties influences the electoral fortunes of the new, niche party actors. In contrast to standard spatial theories, my theory recognizes that party tactics work by altering the salience and ownership of issues for political competition, not just party issue positions. It follows that niche party support can be shaped by both proximal and non-proximal competitors. Analysis of green and radical right party vote in 17 Western European countries from 1970 to 2000 confirms that mainstream party strategies matter; the modified spatial theory accounts for the failure and success of niche parties across countries and over time better than institutional, sociological, and even standard spatial explanations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Meguid","given":"Bonnie M."}],"citation-key":"meguidCompetitionUnequalsRole2005","container-title":"American Political Science Review","DOI":"10.1017/S0003055405051701","ISSN":"1537-5943, 0003-0554","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,8]]},"language":"en","page":"347-359","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Competition Between Unequals: The Role of Mainstream Party Strategy in Niche Party Success","title-short":"Competition Between Unequals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/competition-between-unequals-the-role-of-mainstream-party-strategy-in-niche-party-success/74958063576E765C21430A8CB57DCC1B","volume":"99"},
  {"id":"mehlNaturalLanguageIndicators2017","abstract":"Adverse social conditions have been linked to a conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA) in circulating leukocytes that may contribute to social gradients in disease. However, the CNS mechanisms involved remain obscure, in part because CTRA gene-expression profiles often track external social–environmental variables more closely than they do self-reported internal affective states such as stress, depression, or anxiety. This study examined the possibility that variations in patterns of natural language use might provide more sensitive indicators of the automatic threat-detection and -response systems that proximally regulate autonomic induction of the CTRA. In 22,627 audio samples of natural speech sampled from the daily interactions of 143 healthy adults, both total language output and patterns of function-word use covaried with CTRA gene expression. These language features predicted CTRA gene expression substantially better than did conventional self-report measures of stress, depression, and anxiety and did so independently of demographic and behavioral factors (age, sex, race, smoking, body mass index) and leukocyte subset distributions. This predictive relationship held when language and gene expression were sampled more than a week apart, suggesting that associations reflect stable individual differences or chronic life circumstances. Given the observed relationship between personal expression and gene expression, patterns of natural language use may provide a useful behavioral indicator of nonconsciously evaluated well-being (implicit safety vs. threat) that is distinct from conscious affective experience and more closely tracks the neurobiological processes involved in peripheral gene regulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Mehl","given":"Matthias R."},{"family":"Raison","given":"Charles L."},{"family":"Pace","given":"Thaddeus W.

Furthermore, two scaling exponents, q -parameter and α -exponent, are combined to classify personal writing style with acceptable high resolution power. The q -parameter, generally known as the nonextensivity measure, is calculated for degree distribution and the α -exponent comes from a power law relationship between number of links and number of nodes in the co-occurrence network constructed for different books written by each author. The applicability of the presented method is evaluated in an experiment with thirty six books of five Persian litterateurs.

As the latter properties have rarely been discussed explicitly before, other existing comparison criteria are also examined in their light. Finally we present the VI from an axiomatic point of view, showing that it is the only “sensible” criterion for comparing partitions that is both aligned to the lattice and convexely additive. As a consequence, we prove an impossibility result for comparing partitions: there is no criterion for comparing partitions that simultaneously satisfies the above two desirable properties and is bounded.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Meilă","given":"Marina"}],"citation-key":"meilaComparingClusteringsInformation2007","container-title":"Journal of Multivariate Analysis","container-title-short":"Journal of Multivariate Analysis","DOI":"10.1016/j.jmva.2006.11.013","ISSN":"0047-259X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"873-895","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Comparing clusterings—an information based distance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047259X06002016","volume":"98"},

The attractiveness of artistic occupations is high but has to be balanced against the risk of failure and of an unsuccessful professionalization that turns ideally non-routine jobs into ordinary or ephemeral undertakings. Earnings distributions are extremely skewed. Risk has to be managed, mainly through flexibility and cost reducing means at the organizational level and through multiple job holding at the individual level.

  {"id":"mertonMatthewEffectScience1968","abstract":"This account of the Matthew effect is another small exercise in the psychosociological analysis of the workings of science as a social institution. The initial problem is transformed by a shift in theoretical perspective. As originally identified, the Matthew effect was construed in terms of enhancement of the position of already eminent scientists who are given disproportionate credit in cases of collaboration or of independent multiple discoveries. Its significance was thus confined to its implications for the reward system of science. By shifting the angle of vision, we note other possible kinds of consequences, this time for the communication system of science. The Matthew effect may serve to heighten the visibility of contributions to science by scientists of acknowledged standing and to reduce the visibility of contributions by authors who are less well known. We examine the psychosocial conditions and mechanisms underlying this effect and find a correlation between the redundancy function of multiple discoveries and the focalizing function of eminent men of science—a function which is reinforced by the great value these men place upon finding basic problems and by their self-assurance. This self-assurance, which is partly inherent, partly the result of experiences and associations in creative scientific environments, and partly a result of later social validation of their position, encourages them to search out risky but important problems and to highlight the results of their inquiry. A macrosocial version of the Matthew principle is apparently involved in those processes of social selection that currently lead to the concentration of scientific resources and talent (50).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Merton","given":"Robert K."}],"citation-key":"mertonMatthewEffectScience1968","container-title":"Science","container-title-short":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.159.3810.56","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"3810","issued":{"date-parts":[[1968,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"56-63","source":"www.sciencemag.org","title":"The Matthew Effect in Science The Reward and Communication Systems of Science Are Considered","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/159/3810/56","volume":"159"},

  {"id":"mertonThreeFragmentsSociologist1987","abstract":"This occasionally biographical paper deals with three cognitive and social patterns in the practice of science (not 'the scientific method’). The first, “establishing the phenomenon,” involves the doctrine (universally accepted in the abstract) that phenomena should of course be shown to exist or to occur before one explains why they exist or how they come to be; sources of departure in practice from this seemingly self-evident principle are examined. One parochial case of such a departure is considered in detail. The second pattern is the particular form of ignorance described as “specified ignorance”: the express recognition of what is not yet known but needs to be known in order to lay the foundation for still more knowledge. The substantial role of this practice in the sciences is identified and the case of successive specification of ignorance in the evolving sociological theory of deviant behavior by four thought-collectives is sketched out. Reference is made to the virtual institutionalization of specified ignorance in some sciences and the question is raised whether scientific disciplines differ in the extent of routinely specifying ignorance and how this affects the growth of knowledge. The two patterns of scientific practice are linked to a third: the use of “strategic research materials (SRMs)” i.e. strategic research sites, objects, or events that exhibit the phenomena to be explained or interpreted to such advantage and in such accessible form that they enable the fruitful investigation of previously stubborn problems and the discovery of new problems for further inquiry. The development of biology is taken as a self-exemplifying case since it provides innumerable SRMs for the sociological study of the selection and consequences of SRMs in science. The differing role of SRMs in the natural sciences and in the Geisteswissenschaften is identified and several cases of strategic research sites and events in sociology, explored.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Merton","given":"Robert K."}],"citation-key":"mertonThreeFragmentsSociologist1987","container-title":"Annual Review of Sociology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.so.13.080187.000245","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1987]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.so.13.080187.000245","page":"1-29","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Three Fragments From a Sociologist's Notebooks: Establishing the Phenomenon, Specified Ignorance, and Strategic Research Materials","title-short":"Three Fragments From a Sociologist's Notebooks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.so.13.080187.000245","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"meyer-krahmerSciencebasedTechnologiesUniversity1998","abstract":"In recent years, the co-operation between industrial firms and universities has increased considerably, but the interaction pattern in different technological fields is not uniform. In science-based fields, university departments have a distinct focus on basic research and the major interest of industry is the observation of science. In less science-based fields, the solution of technical problems is a major concern of industry. In all fields, the exchange of knowledge in techno-scientific communities is a crucial element of interaction. In Germany, strong intra-disciplinary ties between universities and industry in mechanical engineering obviously imply an insufficient openness to, and integration of, new technologies. The particular combination of a long-standing culture of co-operation and the economic success in the mechanical industry can be interpreted in terms of a specific path-dependant evolution of a stable sector of the national system of innovation, but with the tendency to lock-in effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Meyer-Krahmer","given":"Frieder"},{"family":"Schmoch","given":"Ulrich"}],"citation-key":"meyer-krahmerSciencebasedTechnologiesUniversity1998","container-title":"Research Policy","container-title-short":"Research Policy","DOI":"10.1016/S0048-7333(98)00094-8","ISSN":"0048-7333","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998,12]]},"page":"835-851","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Science-based technologies: university–industry interactions in four fields","title-short":"Science-based technologies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733398000948","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"michelsGrowthScienceDatabase2012","abstract":"Recently there has been huge growth in the number of articles displayed on the Web of Science (WoS), but it is unclear whether this is linked to a growth of science or simply additional coverage of already existing journals by the database provider. An analysis of the category of journals in the period of 2000–2008 shows that the number of basic journals covered by Web of Science (WoS) steadily decreased, whereas the number of new, recently established journals increased. A rising number of older journals is also covered. These developments imply a crescive number of articles, but a more significant effect is the enlargement of traditional, basic journals in terms of annual articles. All in all it becomes obvious that the data set is quite instable due to high fluctuation caused by the annual selection criteria, the impact factor. In any case, it is important to look at the structures at the level of specific fields in order to differentiate between “real” and “artificial” growth. Our findings suggest that even-though a growth of about 34 % can be measured in article numbers in the period of 2000–2008, 17 % of this growth stems from the inclusion of old journals that have been published for a longer time but were simply not included in the database so far.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Michels","given":"Carolin"},{"family":"Schmoch","given":"Ulrich"}],"citation-key":"michelsGrowthScienceDatabase2012","container-title":"Scientometrics","container-title-short":"Scientometrics","DOI":"10.1007/s11192-012-0732-7","ISSN":"0138-9130, 1588-2861","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,4,17]]},"language":"en","page":"831-846","source":"link.springer.com","title":"The growth of science and database coverage","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-012-0732-7","volume":"93"},

  {"id":"millerActiveLearningApproaches2020","abstract":"Supervised machine learning methods are increasingly employed in political science. Such models require costly manual labeling of documents. In this paper, we introduce active learning, a framework in which data to be labeled by human coders are not chosen at random but rather targeted in such a way that the required amount of data to train a machine learning model can be minimized. We study the benefits of active learning using text data examples. We perform simulation studies that illustrate conditions where active learning can reduce the cost of labeling text data. We perform these simulations on three corpora that vary in size, document length, and domain. We find that in cases where the document class of interest is not balanced, researchers can label a fraction of the documents one would need using random sampling (or “passive” learning) to achieve equally performing classifiers. We further investigate how varying levels of intercoder reliability affect the active learning procedures and find that even with low reliability, active learning performs more efficiently than does random sampling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Blake"},{"family":"Linder","given":"Fridolin"},{"family":"Mebane","given":"Walter R."}],"citation-key":"millerActiveLearningApproaches2020","container-title":"Political Analysis","DOI":"10.1017/pan.2020.4","ISSN":"1047-1987, 1476-4989","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10]]},"language":"en","page":"532-551","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Active Learning Approaches for Labeling Text: Review and Assessment of the Performance of Active Learning Approaches","title-short":"Active Learning Approaches for Labeling Text","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/active-learning-approaches-for-labeling-text-review-and-assessment-of-the-performance-of-active-learning-approaches/CF6AAF05F465D5BC688A9548433123C1","volume":"28"},
  {"id":"millerAllocationPrestigiousPositions2005","abstract":"More than 200 freshly minted doctoral graduates enter the field of organization science every year. A non-trivial number of existing faculty members move from one university to another every year, while other organization science faculty leave academia to enter retirement, consulting, or industry. Despite the importance of this large, complex system of entries and exits, few attempts have been made to explicitly understand how the system works. Drawing upon sociology of science and careers research, we studied the underlying form of the position allocation system by focusing on the relative importance of research success and prior affiliations as antecedents of movement and stability across positions. We used three theoretical models: accumulative advantage, sponsored mobility, and contest mobility. Tracking hundreds of faculty members for 16 years post doctorate, we find a downward cascading of affiliation prestige over time that affects people more dramatically and quickly than we expected, especially women. Accumulative advantage, the most predictive of our models, does help to maintain relative but not absolute prestige, at least until its effects wane in later years of the career. These findings are relevant to scholars interested in the sociology of science, organization scholars interested in the underlying dynamics of their discipline, and individuals making career choices.

  {"id":"millerTurningCallonRight2002","abstract":"This paper argues that, contrary to his own claims, Callon's work amounts to a defence of the economists' model of a framed and abstracted market against empirical evidence that contemporary exchange rarely if ever works according to the laws of the market. I start with an example from an Indian village, which shows how other societies also try to frame particular genres of exchange to protect themselves from other varieties of exchange. But both there and within capitalism the frame is precisely a moral system of how exchange ought to be carried out. I then use the example of car purchasing to suggest the highly entangled world of actual exchange within capitalism both between the exchange partners and also between consumers and commerce more generally. Indeed, the actual case studies in Callon's The Laws of the Markets seem to support this conclusion rather than the model put forward in his own introduction and conclusion. These studies, as others cited here, suggest the centrality of entanglements also for higher-level exchanges, such as stock markets and corporate take-overs, and not just for shoppers or other individual actors. As an alternative to Callon I briefly summarize an argument published elsewhere, called 'virtualism', in which I examine the increasing ability of economists and other agents of abstract models such as audit and consultancy to transform the world into closer approximations of their theories and models. I suggest this provides a more fruitful way of understanding the growth and power of abstraction in the contemporary economy.","author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"millerTurningCallonRight2002","container-title":"Economy and Society","DOI":"10.1080/03085140220123135","ISSN":"0308-5147","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"page":"218-233","source":"Taylor&Francis","title":"Turning Callon the right way up","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03085140220123135","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"mitraHandbookNewsAnalytics2011","abstract":"The Handbook of News Analytics in Finance is a landmark publication bringing together the latest models and applications of News Analytics for asset pricing, portfolio construction, trading and risk control. The content of the Hand Book is organised to provide a rapid yet comprehensive understanding of this topic. Chapter 1 sets out an overview of News Analytics (NA) with an explanation of the technology and applications. The rest of the chapters are presented in four parts. Part 1 contains an explanation of methods and models which are used to measure and quantify news sentiment. In Part 2 the relationship between news events and discovery of abnormal returns (the elusive alpha) is discussed in detail by the leading researchers and industry experts. The material in this part also covers potential application of NA to trading and fund management. Part 3 covers the use of quantified news for the purpose of monitoring, early diagnostics and risk control. Part 4 is entirely industry focused; it contains insights of experts from leading technology (content) vendors. It also contains a discussion of technologies and finally a compact directory of content vendor and financial analytics companies in the marketplace of NA.  The book draws equally upon the expertise of academics and practitioners who have developed these models and is supported by two major content vendors - RavenPack and Thomson Reuters - leading providers of news analytics software and machine readable news. The book will appeal to decision makers in the banking, finance and insurance services industry.  In particular: asset managers; quantitative fund managers; hedge fund managers; algorithmic traders; proprietary (program) trading desks; sell-side firms; brokerage houses; risk managers and research departments will benefit from the unique insights into this new and pertinent area of financial modelling.","author":[{"family":"Mitra","given":"Gautam"},{"family":"Mitra","given":"Leela"}],"citation-key":"mitraHandbookNewsAnalytics2011","ISBN":"978-1-119-99080-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7,13]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"386","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","source":"Google Books","title":"The Handbook of News Analytics in Finance","type":"book"},

It is also part of their larger efforts to critique the present. In this article, I seek to find analogues of this sense of temporal incongruity between knowledge and its objects in the Tokyo financial markets. My focus is on the anxieties and hopes animating some Japanese securities traders' life choices. I argue that these traders' differing anxieties and hopes resulted from their divergent senses of the temporal incongruity among trading strategies, workplaces, and Japan's national location vis–a–vis the United States. Drawing on a parallel between social theorists' and traders' efforts to generate prospective momentum in their work, I propose that anthropologists investigate the work of temporal incongruity in knowledge formation more generally.

  {"id":"moghadasProjectingHospitalUtilization2020","abstract":"<p>In the wake of community coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission in the United States, there is a growing public health concern regarding the adequacy of resources to treat infected cases. Hospital beds, intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators are vital for the treatment of patients with severe illness. To project the timing of the outbreak peak and the number of ICU beds required at peak, we simulated a COVID-19 outbreak parameterized with the US population demographics. In scenario analyses, we varied the delay from symptom onset to self-isolation, the proportion of symptomatic individuals practicing self-isolation, and the basic reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>. Without self-isolation, when <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> = 2.5, treatment of critically ill individuals at the outbreak peak would require 3.8 times more ICU beds than exist in the United States. Self-isolation by 20% of cases 24 h after symptom onset would delay and flatten the outbreak trajectory, reducing the number of ICU beds needed at the peak by 48.4% (interquartile range 46.4–50.3%), although still exceeding existing capacity. When <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> = 2, twice as many ICU beds would be required at the peak of outbreak in the absence of self-isolation. In this scenario, the proportional impact of self-isolation within 24 h on reducing the peak number of ICU beds is substantially higher at 73.5% (interquartile range 71.4–75.3%). Our estimates underscore the inadequacy of critical care capacity to handle the burgeoning outbreak. Policies that encourage self-isolation, such as paid sick leave, may delay the epidemic peak, giving a window of time that could facilitate emergency mobilization to expand hospital capacity.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Moghadas","given":"Seyed M."},{"family":"Shoukat","given":"Affan"},{"family":"Fitzpatrick","given":"Meagan C."},{"family":"Wells","given":"Chad R."},{"family":"Sah","given":"Pratha"},{"family":"Pandey","given":"Abhishek"},{"family":"Sachs","given":"Jeffrey D."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zheng"},{"family":"Meyers","given":"Lauren A."},{"family":"Singer","given":"Burton H."},{"family":"Galvani","given":"Alison P."}],"citation-key":"moghadasProjectingHospitalUtilization2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2004064117","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,3]]},"language":"en","PMID":"32245814","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Projecting hospital utilization during the COVID-19 outbreaks in the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/04/02/2004064117"},

In this paper we show how the combined strength and wisdom of the crowds can be used to generate a large, high-quality, word-emotion and word-polarity association lexicon quickly and inexpensively. We enumerate the challenges in emotion annotation in a crowdsourcing scenario and propose solutions to address them. Most notably, in addition to questions about emotions associated with terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage malicious data entry, help identify instances where the annotator may not be familiar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and help obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level). We conducted experiments on how to formulate the emotion-annotation questions, and show that asking if a term is associated with an emotion leads to markedly higher inter-annotator agreement than that obtained by asking if a term evokes an emotion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Mohammad","given":"Saif M."},{"family":"Turney","given":"Peter D."}],"citation-key":"mohammadCrowdsourcingWordEmotionAssociation2013","container-title":"arXiv:1308.6297 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,8,28]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Crowdsourcing a Word-Emotion Association Lexicon","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.6297"},

Notably, we found that a lack of meeting opportunities is an important reason why many personal relationships are discontinued, and that a path-dependent use of social contexts makes new relationships more likely to emerge in a specific context if existing network members are already met in that context.

We analyze aggregated, age-specific mobility trends from more than 10 million individuals in the US and link these mechanistically to age-specific COVID-19 mortality data. We estimate that as of October 2020, individuals aged 20-49 are the only age groups sustaining resurgent SARS-CoV-2 transmission with reproduction numbers well above one, and that at least 65 of 100 COVID-19 infections originate from individuals aged 20-49 in the US.

The results show that participation in the sociology collaboration network depends on research specialty and that quantitative work is more likely to be coauthored than non-quantitative work.

  {"id":"morganFeedingPipelineGender2013","abstract":"In this article, we analyze gender differences in college major selection for respondents to the Education Longitudinal Study (2002-2006), focusing on educational pathways through college that lead to science, engineering, or doctoral-track medicine occupations and to non-doctoral track clinical and health sciences occupations. We show that gender differences in college major selection remain substantial, even for a cohort in which rates of enrollment in postsecondary education are more than ten percent higher for young women than for young men. Consistent with other recent research, we demonstrate that neither gender differences in work-family goals nor in academic preparation explain a substantial portion of these differences. However, the occupational plans of high school seniors are strong predictors of initial college major selection, a finding that is revealed only when occupational plans are measured with sufficient detail, here by using the verbatim responses of students. We also find that the association between occupational plans and college major selection is not attributable to work-family orientation or academic preparation. Finally, we find gender differences in the associations between occupational plans and college major selection that are consistent with prior research on STEM attrition, as well as with the claim that attrition also affects the selection of majors that are gateways into doctoral-track medicine. We discuss the implications of the predictive power of occupational plans formed in adolescence for understanding sex segregation and for policies intended to create a gender-balanced STEM and doctoral-level medical workforce.","author":[{"family":"Morgan","given":"Stephen L."},{"family":"Gelbgiser","given":"Dafna"},{"family":"Weeden","given":"Kim A."}],"citation-key":"morganFeedingPipelineGender2013","container-title":"Social Science Research","container-title-short":"Soc Sci Res","DOI":"10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.03.008","ISSN":"0049-089X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,7]]},"language":"eng","page":"989-1005","PMID":"23721669","source":"PubMed","title":"Feeding the pipeline: Gender, occupational plans, and college major selection","title-short":"Feeding the pipeline","type":"article-journal","volume":"42"},
  {"id":"morganIntergenerationalClosureAcademic2009","abstract":"This article reexamines the conjecture of James S. Coleman that intergenerational social closure promotes student achievement in high schools, analyzing the best national data on academic achievement and social networks: the 2002 and 2004 waves of the Education Longitudinal Study. The results show that within the Catholic school sector, schools that are characterized by dense parental networks have substantially higher average student achievement. This association can be reduced but not eliminated by conditioning on available measures of student network structure and standard measures of family background. In contrast, in the public school sector, a similarly strong bivariate association between dense parental networks and student achievement can be attributed almost entirely to these basic conditioning variables. These results represent, at best, a mixed verdict for Coleman's predictions. Intergenerational closure in its currently observed form does not increase achievement in public schools, suggesting that parental monitoring of discipline does not outweigh some of the costs of parental closure. However, intergenerational closure may increase achievement in Catholic schools to a modest degree because Catholic schools are affiliated with religious communities that have appropriable norms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Morgan","given":"Stephen L."},{"family":"Todd","given":"Jennifer J."}],"citation-key":"morganIntergenerationalClosureAcademic2009","container-title":"Sociology of Education","container-title-short":"Sociol Educ","DOI":"10.1177/003804070908200304","ISSN":"0038-0407","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"267-286","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Intergenerational Closure and Academic Achievement in High School: A New Evaluation of Coleman's Conjecture","title-short":"Intergenerational Closure and Academic Achievement in High School","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/003804070908200304","volume":"82"},
  {"id":"morganParentalNetworksSocial1999","abstract":"Through an analysis of gains in mathematics achievement between the tenth and twelfth grades for respondents to the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, we examine Coleman's explanation for why Catholic schools apparently produce more learning than public schools. According to Coleman, Catholic schools benefit from larger endowments of social capital, generated in part through greater intergenerational social closure (i.e., dense network connections between the parents of students). Instead, we find that for public schools, social closure among parents is negatively associated with achievement gains in mathematics, net of friendship density among students. This evidence of a negative effect of parental social closure within the public school sector lends support to our alternative hypothesis that horizon-expanding schools foster more learning than do norm-enforcing schools. Moreover, this result renders social closure incapable of explaining any portion of the Catholic school effect on learning, even though within the Catholic school sector there is some evidence that social closure is positively associated with learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,28]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Morgan","given":"Stephen L."},{"family":"Sørensen","given":"Aage B."}],"citation-key":"morganParentalNetworksSocial1999","container-title":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.2307/2657368","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999]]},"page":"661-681","publisher":"[American Sociological Association, Sage Publications, Inc.]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Parental Networks, Social Closure, and Mathematics Learning: A Test of Coleman's Social Capital Explanation of School Effects","title-short":"Parental Networks, Social Closure, and Mathematics Learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657368","volume":"64"},

  {"id":"morrisScholarDeniedBois2015","abstract":"In this groundbreaking book, Aldon D. Morris’s ambition is truly monumental: to help rewrite the history of sociology and to acknowledge the primacy of W. E. B. Du Bois’s work in the founding of the discipline. Calling into question the prevailing narrative of how sociology developed, Morris, a major scholar of social movements, probes the way in which the history of the discipline has traditionally given credit to Robert E. Park at the University of Chicago, who worked with the conservative black leader Booker T. Washington to render Du Bois invisible. Morris uncovers the seminal theoretical work of Du Bois in developing a “scientific” sociology through a variety of methodologies and examines how the leading scholars of the day disparaged and ignored Du Bois’s work.The Scholar Denied is based on extensive, rigorous primary source research; the book is the result of a decade of research, writing, and revision. In exposing the economic and political factors that marginalized the contributions of Du Bois and enabled Park and his colleagues to be recognized as the “fathers” of the discipline, Morris delivers a wholly new narrative of American intellectual and social history that places one of America’s key intellectuals, W. E. B. Du Bois, at its center.The Scholar Denied is a must-read for anyone interested in American history, racial inequality, and the academy. In challenging our understanding of the past, the book promises to engender debate and discussion.","author":[{"family":"Morris","given":"Aldon"}],"citation-key":"morrisScholarDeniedBois2015","edition":"First Edition","event-place":"Oakland, California","ISBN":"978-0-520-27635-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,8,27]]},"language":"Englisch","number-of-pages":"320","publisher":"University of California Press","publisher-place":"Oakland, California","source":"Amazon","title":"The Scholar Denied: W.

  {"id":"mossnerThoughtStylesParadigms2011","abstract":"At first glance there seem to be many similarities between Thomas S. Kuhn’s and Ludwik Fleck’s accounts of the development of scientific knowledge. Notably, both pay attention to the role played by the scientific community in the development of scientific knowledge. But putting first impressions aside, one can criticise some philosophers for being too hasty in their attempt to find supposed similarities in the works of the two men. Having acknowledged that Fleck anticipated some of Kuhn’s later theses, there seems to be a temptation in more recent research to equate both theories in important respects. Because of this approach, one has to deal with the problem of comparing the most notable technical terms of both philosophers, namely “thought style” and “paradigm”. This paper aims at a more thorough comparison between Ludwik Fleck’s concept of thought style and Thomas Kuhn’s concept of paradigm. Although some philosophers suggest that these two concepts are essentially equal in content, a closer examination reveals that this is not the case. This thesis of inequality will be defended in detail, also taking into account some of the alleged similarities which may be responsible for losing sight of the differences between these theories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Mößner","given":"Nicola"}],"citation-key":"mossnerThoughtStylesParadigms2011","collection-title":"Model-Based Representation in Scientific Practice","container-title":"Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A","container-title-short":"Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A","DOI":"10.1016/j.shpsa.2010.12.002","ISSN":"0039-3681","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"362-371","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Thought styles and paradigms—a comparative study of Ludwik Fleck and Thomas S.

  {"id":"mozerMatchingTextData2020","abstract":"Matching for causal inference is a well-studied problem, but standard methods fail when the units to match are text documents: the high-dimensional and rich nature of the data renders exact matching infeasible, causes propensity scores to produce incomparable matches, and makes assessing match quality difficult. In this paper, we characterize a framework for matching text documents that decomposes existing methods into (1) the choice of text representation and (2) the choice of distance metric. We investigate how different choices within this framework affect both the quantity and quality of matches identified through a systematic multifactor evaluation experiment using human subjects. Altogether, we evaluate over 100 unique text-matching methods along with 5 comparison methods taken from the literature. Our experimental results identify methods that generate matches with higher subjective match quality than current state-of-the-art techniques. We enhance the precision of these results by developing a predictive model to estimate the match quality of pairs of text documents as a function of our various distance scores. This model, which we find successfully mimics human judgment, also allows for approximate and unsupervised evaluation of new procedures in our context. We then employ the identified best method to illustrate the utility of text matching in two applications. First, we engage with a substantive debate in the study of media bias by using text matching to control for topic selection when comparing news articles from thirteen news sources. We then show how conditioning on text data leads to more precise causal inferences in an observational study examining the effects of a medical intervention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Mozer","given":"Reagan"},{"family":"Miratrix","given":"Luke"},{"family":"Kaufman","given":"Aaron Russell"},{"family":"Anastasopoulos","given":"L.

On the other hand, those who have been doing comparative research on populism stay in their comfort zone and thus do not try to link their work to other academic fields.

Emphasizing neo-liberalism's third ‘face’, it argues that a failure to grasp neo-liberalism as a political form imposes two limitations on understanding its effects: (i) fostering an implicit assumption that European political elites are ‘naturally’ opposed to the implementation of neo-liberal policies; and (ii) tending to pre-empt inquiry into an unsettling fact—namely, that the most effective advocates of policies understood as neo-liberal in Western Europe (and beyond) have often been elites who are sympathetic to, or are representatives of, the left and centre-left.

  {"id":"mulawaEvidenceSocialNetwork2016","abstract":"Research on network-level influences on HIV risk behaviors among young men in sub-Saharan Africa is severely lacking. One significant gap in the literature that may provide direction for future research with this population is understanding the degree to which various HIV risk behaviors and normative beliefs cluster within men's social networks. Such research may help us understand which HIV-related norms and behaviors have the greatest potential to be changed through social influence. Additionally, few network-based studies have described the structure of social networks of young men in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding the structure of men's peer networks may motivate future research examining the ways in which network structures shape the spread of information, adoption of norms, and diffusion of behaviors. We contribute to filling these gaps by using social network analysis and multilevel modeling to describe a unique dataset of mostly young men (n = 1249 men and 242 women) nested within 59 urban social networks in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We examine the means, ranges, and clustering of men's HIV-related normative beliefs and behaviors. Networks in this urban setting varied substantially in both composition and structure and a large proportion of men engaged in risky behaviors including inconsistent condom use, sexual partner concurrency, and intimate partner violence perpetration. We found significant clustering of normative beliefs and risk behaviors within these men's social networks. Specifically, network membership explained between 5.78 and 7.17% of variance in men's normative beliefs and between 1.93 and 15.79% of variance in risk behaviors. Our results suggest that social networks are important socialization sites for young men and may influence the adoption of norms and behaviors. We conclude by calling for more research on men's social networks in Sub-Saharan Africa and map out several areas of future inquiry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Mulawa","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Yamanis","given":"Thespina J."},{"family":"Hill","given":"Lauren M."},{"family":"Balvanz","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Kajula","given":"Lusajo J."},{"family":"Maman","given":"Suzanne"}],"citation-key":"mulawaEvidenceSocialNetwork2016","container-title":"Social Science & Medicine","container-title-short":"Social Science & Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.02.002","ISSN":"0277-9536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"35-43","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Evidence of social network influence on multiple HIV risk behaviors and normative beliefs among young Tanzanian men","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953616300570","volume":"153"},

  {"id":"mullerSensorbasedProximityMetrics2020","abstract":"Wearable sensors are becoming increasingly popular in organizational research. Although validation studies that examine sensor data in conjunction with established social and psychological constructs are becoming more frequent, they are usually limited for two reasons: first, most validation studies are carried out under laboratory settings. Only a handful of studies have been carried out in real-world organizational environments. Second, for those studies carried out in field settings, reported findings are derived from a single case only, thus seriously limiting the possibility of studying the influence of contextual factors on sensor-based measurements. This article presents a validation study of expressive and instrumental ties across nine relatively small R&D teams. The convergent validity of Bluetooth (BT) detections is reported for friendship and advice-seeking ties under three organizational contexts: research labs, private companies, and university-based teams. Results show that, in general, BT detections correlated strongly with self-reported measurements. However, the organizational context affects both the strength of the observed correlation and its direction. Whereas advice-seeking ties generally occur in close spatial proximity and are best identified in university environments, friendship relationships occur at a greater spatial distance, especially in research labs. We conclude with recommendations for fine-tuning the validity of sensor measurements by carefully examining the opportunities for organizational embedding in relation to the research question and collecting complementary data through mixed-method research designs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Müller","given":"Jörg"},{"family":"Meneses","given":"Julio"},{"family":"Humbert","given":"Anne Laure"},{"family":"Guenther","given":"Elisabeth Anna"}],"citation-key":"mullerSensorbasedProximityMetrics2020","container-title":"Behavior Research Methods","container-title-short":"Behav Res","DOI":"10.3758/s13428-020-01444-x","ISSN":"1554-3528","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,19]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"Sensor-based proximity metrics for team research.

Die ökonomische Lehre der komparativen Kostenvorteile weist nach, dass es sich dabei um keine Wunschvorstellung handelt, sondern um eine wissenschaftlich gut abgesicherte Voraussage. Allerdings sagen die Ökonomen auch, dass eine Währungsunion ohne eine Wirtschaftsunion nicht funktionieren kann, weil sonst diejenigen Verwerfungen auftreten, die nun tatsächlich zum Problem geworden sind.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Münch","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"munchEuropaischeIntegrationsprojektKrise2014","container-title":"Krise der europäischen Vergesellschaftung?","editor":[{"family":"Heidenreich","given":"Martin"}],"event-place":"Wiesbaden","ISBN":"978-3-658-03924-0 978-3-658-03925-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,1]]},"language":"de","page":"53-85","publisher":"Springer VS","publisher-place":"Wiesbaden","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Das europäische Integrationsprojekt in der Krise.

Dadurch wird die transnationale Dimension von Solidarität und Gerechtigkeit an Bedeutung gewinnen. Gleichzeitig werden in Zukunft nicht mehr Gruppenzugehörigkeiten über Inklusion oder Exklusion entscheiden, sondern individuelle Fähigkeiten.

  {"id":"munchTalcottParsonsTheory1982","abstract":"In The Structure of Social Action, Talcott Parsons developed a theory of action which corresponds in structure and method to Kant's critical philosophy. The core of this theory is the assertion that every action is to be understood as a product of the interaction of dynamizing and controlling forces. This basic proposition is elaborated into a theory through the construction of a four-dimensional \"action space,\" which can be further differentiated into subsystems possessing varying degrees of orderedness. The differential effect of dynamizing and ordering forces on any given action is determined by its locationin the action space and by the kind of relation obtaining between the subsystemsof the action space. The relation between these subsystems which enables them simultaneously to expand their areas of effectiveness is interpenetration. The entire development of Talcott Parsons's theory of action is a progressive refinement of the theoretical devices available for the analysis of such processes of interpenetration. This is demonstrated in this essay for all the various stages of Parsons's theoretical development, from the laying down of thetheoretical core in The Structure of Social Action (1937) through The Social System (1951) to Action Theory and the Human Condition (1978).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Münch","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"munchTalcottParsonsTheory1982","container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","container-title-short":"American Journal of Sociology","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1982]]},"page":"771-826","source":"JSTOR","title":"Talcott Parsons and the Theory of Action.

We here focus on financial markets as an example of a complex system. In particular we analyze financial data from the S&P 500 stocks in the 19-year period 1992–2010. We propose a definition of state for a financial market and use it to identify points of drastic change in the correlation structure. These points are mapped to occurrences of financial crises. We find that a wide variety of characteristic correlation structure patterns exist in the observation time window, and that these characteristic correlation structure patterns can be classified into several typical “market states”. Using this classification we recognize transitions between different market states. A similarity measure we develop thus affords means of understanding changes in states and of recognizing developments not previously seen.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Münnix","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Shimada","given":"Takashi"},{"family":"Schäfer","given":"Rudi"},{"family":"Leyvraz","given":"Francois"},{"family":"Seligman","given":"Thomas H."},{"family":"Guhr","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Stanley","given":"H.

  {"id":"mutzelNetzwerkansatzeWirtschaftssoziologie2010","abstract":"Die neue Wirtschaftssoziologie versteht ökonomisches Handeln als soziales Handeln, das eingebettet in soziale Kontexte stattfindet. Aufbauend auf den soziologischen Klassikern prägt vor allem eine relationale Blickweise auf wirtschaftliches Handeln das sich seit Anfang der 1980er Jahre entwickelnde Forschungsfeld. Dabei stehen Analysen der Voraussetzungen und Konsequenzen von Netzwerken für das wirtschaftliche Handeln im Vordergrund. So können Studien zeigen, dass die Position im Netzwerk das Handeln von Unternehmen beeinflusst (z.B. Gulati und Higgins 2003) und unternehmerisches Handeln möglich macht (z.B. Burt 2004). Zentrales methodisches Instrument ist dafür die Netzwerkanalyse, deren Verbreitung und Institutionalisierung in den Sozialwissenschaften seit den 1970ern in enger Verflechtung mit den Entwicklungen der neuen Wirtschaftssoziologie insbesondere in den USA verlief (Beckert 2005; Convert und Heilbron 2007).

  {"id":"nakagawaGeneralSimpleMethod2013","abstract":"The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of ‘variance explained’ (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"Shinichi"},{"family":"Schielzeth","given":"Holger"}],"citation-key":"nakagawaGeneralSimpleMethod2013","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.2041-210x.2012.00261.x","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"133-142","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A general and simple method for obtaining R2 from generalized linear mixed-effects models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2041-210x.2012.00261.x","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"neilSocialChangeCohort2021","abstract":"<p>This article draws on official criminal histories for multiple birth cohorts spanning a 17-y difference in birth year to study how social change can alter our understanding of influential theories and policies about criminal offender groups. Arrest histories are linked to comprehensive longitudinal measurement on over 1,000 individuals originally from Chicago. Using group-based trajectory modeling, we investigated the magnitude and type of cohort differences in trajectories of arrest over the period 1995 to 2020. Our results show that trajectory group membership varies strongly by birth cohort. Membership in the nonoffender group is nearly 15 percentage points higher for cohorts born in the mid-1990s as compared to those born in the 1980s; conversely, older cohorts are more likely to be members of adolescent-limited and chronic-offender groups. Large cohort differences in trajectory group membership persist after controlling for a wide-ranging set of demographic characteristics and early-life risk factors that vary by cohort and that prior research has identified as important influences on crime. Not only does the effect of social change on cohort differentiation persist, but its magnitude is comparable to—indeed larger than—differences in trajectory group membership associated with varying levels of self-control or by whether individuals grew up in high-poverty households. These results suggest that changes in the broader social environment shared by members of the same birth cohort are as powerful in shaping their trajectory group membership as classic predictors identified in prior research, a finding that carries implications for crime-control policies that rely on prediction.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Neil","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Sampson","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Nagin","given":"Daniel S."}],"citation-key":"neilSocialChangeCohort2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2107020118","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"31","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,3]]},"language":"en","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Social Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Social change and cohort differences in group-based arrest trajectories over the last quarter-century","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/118/31/e2107020118","volume":"118"},

Building on these strengths, the fourth edition integrates fresh insights from the current literature with the core tenets of traditional medical sociology, providing students with a thorough grounding in the sociology of health and illness. The text covers a diversity of topics and draws on a wide range of analytic approaches, spanning issues such as the social construction of medical knowledge, the analysis of lay health beliefs, concepts of lifestyles and risk, the experience of illness and the sociology of the body. It also explores matters that are central to health policy, such as professional–patient relationships, health inequalities and the changing nature of health care work. A new chapter has been added, on the sociology of mental health; other chapters have been updated with illustrative examples and questions for discussion. Written for students of the social sciences, this book will also appeal to students taking vocational degrees, such as nursing, medicine and public health, who require a sociological grounding in the area.

  {"id":"nevinAcademicHiringNetworks2019","abstract":"This article examines the academic job market for Canadian sociology through its PhD exchange network. Using an original data set of employed faculty members in 2015 (N = 1,157), I map the hiring relationships between institutions and analyze the observed network structure. My findings show that institutional prestige is a likely organizing force within this network, reflective of a disproportionate number of faculty coming from a few centralized high-status institutions, as well as predominantly downward flows in hiring patterns. However, further investigation is needed to understand the role of prestige in Canadian higher education, which has been previously characterized as having a flat social structure. This requires attention toward the interrelationships between institutional prestige, scholarly competence, and department size situated within a segmented academic field in Canada. Overall, this study aims to encourage collective self-reflection and motivate discourse about status-based inequalities in our own discipline.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Nevin","given":"Andrew D."}],"citation-key":"nevinAcademicHiringNetworks2019","container-title":"Canadian Review of Sociology/Revue canadienne de sociologie","DOI":"10.1111/cars.12252","ISSN":"1755-618X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/cars.12252","page":"389-420","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Academic Hiring Networks and Institutional Prestige: A Case Study of Canadian Sociology","title-short":"Academic Hiring Networks and Institutional Prestige","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cars.12252","volume":"56"},

In this work, we sketch out some sub-tasks that we suggest pave the way towards this goal, and present methods for assessing the coherence and interpretability of topics learned by topic models. Our large-scale user study includes over 70 human subjects evaluating and scoring almost 500 topics learned from collections from a wide range of genres and domains.

The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as “modularity” over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.\nclustering partitioning modules metabolic network social network","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Newman","given":"M.

In this paper we develop in detail the theory of random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. In addition to simple undirected, unipartite graphs, we examine the properties of directed and bipartite graphs. Among other results, we derive exact expressions for the position of the phase transition at which a giant component first forms, the mean component size, the size of the giant component if there is one, the mean number of vertices a certain distance away from a randomly chosen vertex, and the average vertex-vertex distance within a graph. We apply our theory to some real-world graphs, including the world-wide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and Fortune 1000 company directors. We demonstrate that in some cases random graphs with appropriate distributions of vertex degree predict with surprising accuracy the behavior of the real world, while in others there is a measurable discrepancy between theory and reality, perhaps indicating the presence of additional social structure in the network that is not captured by the random graph.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Newman","given":"M.

  {"id":"nielsenOpinionGenderDiversity2017","abstract":"Pick up any recent policy paper on women’s participation in science and you will find assurances that gender diversity enhances knowledge outcomes. Universities and science-policy stakeholders, including the European Commission and the US National Institutes of Health, readily subscribe to this argument (1⇓–3). But is there, in fact, a gender-diversity dividend in science?\n\nThe data suggest that there is. Under the right conditions, teams may benefit from various types of diversity, including scientific discipline, work experience, gender, ethnicity, and nationality. In this paper, we highlight gender diversity (Fig. 1). Guided by key research findings, we propose the following “mechanisms for innovation” specifying why gender diversity matters for scientific discovery and what managers should do to maximize its benefits (Fig. 2). Encouraging greater diversity is not only the right thing to do: it allows scientific organizations to derive an “innovation dividend” that leads to smarter, more creative teams, hence opening the door to new discoveries.\n\n\n\nFig. 1. \nWhen it comes to science collaborations, there’s ample data to suggest that gender diversity pays a substantial research and productivity dividend.

Already, experimental research points to positive links between gender diversity and collective problem solving. In a study of group performance, Anita Woolley et al. (4) randomly assigned 699 participants to teams of varying sizes and asked them to solve a set of both simple and complicated tasks (e.g., visual puzzles, brainstorming, making collective moral judgments, and negotiating over limited resources). Through these experiments, the authors found evidence of a collective intelligence factor that predicts group performance better than the IQ of individual group members.

In the simulations, we assume that people engage in group activities in multiple sectors (e.g., going to work, going to a local grocery store), where they interact with others in the same group and potentially become infected. In the first strategy, each group is divided into two subgroups (e.g., a group of customers can only go to the grocery store in the morning, while another separate group of customers can only go in the afternoon). In the second strategy, we balance the number of group members across different groups within the same sector (e.g., every grocery store has the same number of customers).

Extremes in social mood are characterized by optimistic (pessimistic) aggregate investment and business activity. Second, due to the efficient and emotional nature of stock transactions, the stock market itself is a direct measure or gauge of social mood.

Since the collapse of state socialism in the late 1980s, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and the Slovak Republic have introduced a rather successful model of capitalism when compared with other postsocialist states. This article identifies the key elements of the DME model and discusses their interplay. DMEs have comparative advantages in the assembly and production of relatively complex and durable consumer goods. These comparative advantages are based on institutional complementarities between skilled, but cheap, labor; the transfer of technological innovations within transnational enterprises; and the provision of capital via foreign direct investment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Nölke","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Vliegenthart","given":"Arjan"}],"citation-key":"nolkeEnlargingVarietiesCapitalism2009","container-title":"World Politics","DOI":"10.1017/S0043887109990098","ISSN":"1086-3338","issue":"04","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,10]]},"page":"670–702","source":"Cambridge Journals Online","title":"Enlarging the Varieties of Capitalism: The Emergence of Dependent Market Economies in East Central Europe","title-short":"Enlarging the Varieties of Capitalism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0043887109990098","volume":"61"},

A path from node v 0 to node v k in G is an alternating sequence (v 0 ; (v 0 ; v 1 ); v 1 ; (v 1 ; v 2 ); : : : ; v k\\Gamma1 ; (v k\\Gamma1 ; v k ); v k ) of nodes and edges that belong to V and E, respectively.

  {"id":"obrienCautionRegardingRules2007","abstract":"The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and tolerance are both widely used measures of the degree of multi-collinearity of the ith independent variable with the other independent variables in a regression model. Unfortunately, several rules of thumb – most commonly the rule of 10 – associated with VIF are regarded by many practitioners as a sign of severe or serious multi-collinearity (this rule appears in both scholarly articles and advanced statistical textbooks). When VIF reaches these threshold values researchers often attempt to reduce the collinearity by eliminating one or more variables from their analysis; using Ridge Regression to analyze their data; or combining two or more independent variables into a single index. These techniques for curing problems associated with multi-collinearity can create problems more serious than those they solve. Because of this, we examine these rules of thumb and find that threshold values of the VIF (and tolerance) need to be evaluated in the context of several other factors that influence the variance of regression coefficients. Values of the VIF of 10, 20, 40, or even higher do not, by themselves, discount the results of regression analyses, call for the elimination of one or more independent variables from the analysis, suggest the use of ridge regression, or require combining of independent variable into a single index.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"O’brien","given":"Robert M."}],"citation-key":"obrienCautionRegardingRules2007","container-title":"Quality & Quantity","container-title-short":"Qual Quant","DOI":"10.1007/s11135-006-9018-6","ISSN":"0033-5177, 1573-7845","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"673-690","source":"link.springer.com","title":"A Caution Regarding Rules of Thumb for Variance Inflation Factors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11135-006-9018-6","volume":"41"},
  {"id":"odedOptimalExecutionOpenmarket2009","abstract":"This paper formalizes the following intuition about open-market share repurchases. Firms do open-market share repurchases to return free cash, which would otherwise be wasted. However, when the firm goes to buy its own shares with this cash, it has inside information and hence the actual execution is characterized by adverse selection. The market knows that the firm has inside information, and consequently the ask price is high to compensate for this adverse selection problem. This implies that, all else equal, the greater the adverse selection problem compared to the cash waste problem, the higher the ask price, and, therefore, the wider the bid–ask spread and the lower the share repurchase completion rate. We test this implication on a sample of U.S. firms and report evidence consistent with the model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Oded","given":"Jacob"}],"citation-key":"odedOptimalExecutionOpenmarket2009","container-title":"Journal of Financial Markets","container-title-short":"Journal of Financial Markets","DOI":"10.1016/j.finmar.2009.07.006","ISSN":"1386-4181","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,11]]},"page":"832-869","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Optimal execution of open-market stock repurchase programs","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386418109000433","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"odedWhyFirmsAnnounce2005","abstract":"Empirically, a price increase accompanies the announcement of an open-market stock repurchase program, even though the announcement is not a commitment. In fact, for many announced programs no shares are ever actually repurchased. This article explores this puzzle. In the single-firm-type version of the model, the option that a firm grants itself by announcing a program does not generate announcement returns. In equilibrium, long-run gains from the informed trading that the option creates are offset by short-run costs from the market's accounting for this adverse selection. Based on this trade-off, I construct a signaling (two-type) model that can deliver announcement returns. In the separating equilibrium, good firms do not incur any cost when they announce programs. Their gains from informed trading in the long run offset the cost of announcement incurred in the short run. Mimicry is costly, because a bad firm's long-run gains from informed trading cannot compensate for the short-run cost of announcing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Oded","given":"Jacob"}],"citation-key":"odedWhyFirmsAnnounce2005","container-title":"Review of Financial Studies","container-title-short":"Rev.

First, we demonstrate that economic systems, political systems, religious systems, climates, and geography exert a distal yet important influence on human mind and behavior. Second, we summarize the historical precedents of socioecological psychology. There have been several waves of ecological movements with distinct emphases in the history of psychological science, such as K. Lewin’s (1936, 1939) field theory and U. Bronfenbrenner’s (1977) ecological approach to human development. Environmental and community psychologies, created in the late 1960s and early 1970s, promoted social activism through basic and applied research on ecological factors and social outcomes. Most recently, the rise of cultural psychology has encouraged psychologists to pay attention to cultural factors in basic psychological processes, but note that less attention has been given to socioecological factors per se. We highlight the benefits of bringing the socioecological perspective back to mainstream psychological theorizing and research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Oishi","given":"Shigehiro"},{"family":"Graham","given":"Jesse"}],"citation-key":"oishiSocialEcologyLost2010","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Perspect Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/1745691610374588","ISSN":"1745-6916","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"356-377","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Social Ecology: Lost and Found in Psychological Science","title-short":"Social Ecology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691610374588","volume":"5"},

The nodes of the tree are identified with stocks and the distance between them is a unique function of the corresponding element of the correlation matrix. By using the concept of a central vertex, chosen as the most strongly connected node of the tree, an important characteristic is defined by the mean occupation layer (MOL). During crashes the strong global correlation in the market manifests itself by a low value of MOL. The tree seems to have a scale free structure where the scaling exponent of the degree distribution is different for `business as usual' and `crash' periods. The basic structure of the tree topology is very robust with respect to time. We also point out that the diversification aspect of portfolio optimization results in the fact that the assets of the classic Markowitz portfolio are always located on the outer leaves of the tree. Technical aspects like the window size dependence of the investigated quantities are also discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Onnela","given":"J.-P."},{"family":"Chakraborti","given":"A."},{"family":"Kaski","given":"K."},{"family":"Kertesz","given":"J."},{"family":"Kanto","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"onnelaDynamicsMarketCorrelations2003a","container-title":"Physical Review E","container-title-short":"Phys.

Here we examine the communication patterns of millions of mobile phone users, allowing us to simultaneously study the local and the global structure of a society-wide communication network. We observe a coupling between interaction strengths and the network's local structure, with the counterintuitive consequence that social networks are robust to the removal of the strong ties but fall apart after a phase transition if the weak ties are removed. We show that this coupling significantly slows the diffusion process, resulting in dynamic trapping of information in communities and find that, when it comes to information diffusion, weak and strong ties are both simultaneously ineffective.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Onnela","given":"J.-P."},{"family":"Saramäki","given":"J."},{"family":"Hyvönen","given":"J."},{"family":"Szabó","given":"G."},{"family":"Lazer","given":"D."},{"family":"Kaski","given":"K."},{"family":"Kertész","given":"J."},{"family":"Barabási","given":"A.-L."}],"citation-key":"onnelaStructureTieStrengths2007","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0610245104","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,1,5]]},"language":"en","page":"7332-7336","PMID":"17456605","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Structure and tie strengths in mobile communication networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/104/18/7332","volume":"104"},

From once separate systems with distinct stratification orders, commercial and academic standards for success have become integrated into a hybrid regime where achievement in one realm is dependent upon success in the other.

  {"id":"pachuckiCulturalHolesRelationality2010","abstract":"A burgeoning literature spanning sociologies of culture and social network methods has for the past several decades sought to explicate the relationships between culture and connectivity. A number of promising recent moves toward integration are worthy of review, comparison, critique, and synthesis. Network thinking provides powerful techniques for specifying cultural concepts ranging from narrative networks to classification systems, tastes, and cultural repertoires. At the same time, we see theoretical advances by sociologists of culture as providing a corrective to network analysis as it is often portrayed, as a mere collection of methods. Cultural thinking complements and sets a new agenda for moving beyond predominant forms of structural analysis that ignore action, agency, and intersubjective meaning. The notion of “cultural holes” that we use to organize our review points both to the cultural contingency of network structure and to the increasingly permeable boundary between studies of culture and research on social networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Pachucki","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Breiger","given":"Ronald L."}],"citation-key":"pachuckiCulturalHolesRelationality2010","container-title":"Annual Review of Sociology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102615","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"205-224","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Cultural Holes: Beyond Relationality in Social Networks and Culture","title-short":"Cultural Holes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102615","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"palleyAmericaFlawedParadigm2011","abstract":"This paper traces the roots of the financial crisis and Great Recession to a flawed U.S. macroeconomic paradigm that was adopted around 1980 with the triumph of neoliberal economics. One flaw concerns the growth model. A second flaw concerns the model of global economic engagement that created a triple economic hemorrhage of spending on imports, manufacturing job losses, and off-shoring of investment. The new growth model hollowed out the economy and relied on growing debt and asset price inflation. As the process deepened the economy needed ever larger bubbles to grow. Financial deregulation and excess kept the model going longer than expected, but it meant the economy experienced a financial crash and deeper collapse when the contradictions finally surfaced. The United States needs a new economic paradigm and a new growth model, but as yet this challenge has received little attention from policymakers or economists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Palley","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"palleyAmericaFlawedParadigm2011","container-title":"Empirica","container-title-short":"Empirica","DOI":"10.1007/s10663-010-9142-3","ISSN":"0340-8744, 1573-6911","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"3-17","source":"link.springer.com","title":"America’s flawed paradigm: macroeconomic causes of the financial crisis and great recession","title-short":"America’s flawed paradigm","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10663-010-9142-3","volume":"38"},

An experiment tested these theories by randomizing an anticonflict intervention across 56 schools with 24,191 students. After comprehensively measuring every school’s social network, randomly selected seed groups of 20–32 students from randomly selected schools were assigned to an intervention that encouraged their public stance against conflict at school. Compared with control schools, disciplinary reports of student conflict at treatment schools were reduced by 30% over 1 year. The effect was stronger when the seed group contained more “social referent” students who, as network measures reveal, attract more student attention. Network analyses of peer-to-peer influence show that social referents spread perceptions of conflict as less socially normative.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Paluck","given":"Elizabeth Levy"},{"family":"Shepherd","given":"Hana"},{"family":"Aronow","given":"Peter M."}],"citation-key":"paluckChangingClimatesConflict2016","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1514483113","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,19]]},"language":"en","page":"566-571","PMID":"26729884","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Social Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Changing climates of conflict: A social network experiment in 56 schools","title-short":"Changing climates of conflict","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/113/3/566","volume":"113"},

Some commentators suggest that this is having profound effects across society, that social media have opened up new channels for public debates and have revolutionized the communication of prominent public issues such as climate change. In this article we provide the first systematic and critical review of the literature on social media and climate change. We highlight three key findings from the literature: a substantial bias toward Twitter studies, the prevalent approaches to researching climate change on social media (publics, themes, and professional communication), and important empirical findings (the use of mainstream information sources, discussions of “settled science,” polarization, and responses to temperature anomalies). Following this, we identify gaps in the existing literature that should be addressed by future research: namely, researchers should consider qualitative studies, visual communication and alternative social media platforms to Twitter. We conclude by arguing for further research that goes beyond a focus on science communication to a deeper examination of how publics imagine climate change and its future role in social life.

The top two most influential journals in Internet research are American Economic Review and Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Journals in “Communication” field emerge to be an important source of influence in Internet research, whose mean structural influence ranks third among the eight fields, below “Business” and “Economics/Finance”, but above other five fields. Journals’ structural influences are found to grow over time and the growth rates vary across journals.

We rather suggest a multiobjective process where a number of additional requirements, such as resilience to external attacks and the presence of spatial constraints, limit the ability of the system to achieve maximal transportation performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Perna","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Valverde","given":"Sergi"},{"family":"Gautrais","given":"Jacques"},{"family":"Jost","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Solé","given":"Ricard"},{"family":"Kuntz","given":"Pascale"},{"family":"Theraulaz","given":"Guy"}],"citation-key":"pernaTopologicalEfficiencyThreedimensional2008","container-title":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","container-title-short":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","DOI":"10.1016/j.physa.2008.07.019","ISSN":"0378-4371","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,10,15]]},"page":"6235-6244","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Topological efficiency in three-dimensional gallery networks of termite nests","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437108006675","volume":"387"},
  {"id":"peronCollectiveBehaviorFinancial2011","abstract":"The financial market is an example of a complex system characterized by a highly intricate organization and the emergence of collective behavior. In this paper, this emergent dynamics in the financial market is quantified by using concepts of network synchronization. We consider networks constructed by the correlation matrix of asset returns and study the time evolution of the phase coherence among stock prices. It is verified that during a financial crisis a synchronous state emerges in the system, defining the market's direction. Furthermore, the paper proposes a statistical regression model able to identify the topological features that mostly influence such an emergence. The coefficients of the proposed model indicate that the average shortest path length is the measurement most related to network synchronization. Therefore, during an economic crisis, the stock prices present a similar evolution, which tends to shorten the distances between stocks indicating a collective dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Peron","given":"T.

  {"id":"petersenPersistenceUncertaintyAcademic2012","abstract":"Understanding how institutional changes within academia may affect the overall potential of science requires a better quantitative representation of how careers evolve over time. Because knowledge spillovers, cumulative advantage, competition, and collaboration are distinctive features of the academic profession, both the employment relationship and the procedures for assigning recognition and allocating funding should be designed to account for these factors. We study the annual production ni(t) of a given scientist i by analyzing longitudinal career data for 200 leading scientists and 100 assistant professors from the physics community. Our empirical analysis of individual productivity dynamics shows that (i) there are increasing returns for the top individuals within the competitive cohort, and that (ii) the distribution of production growth is a leptokurtic “tent-shaped” distribution that is remarkably symmetric. Our methodology is general, and we speculate that similar features appear in other disciplines where academic publication is essential and collaboration is a key feature. We introduce a model of proportional growth which reproduces these two observations, and additionally accounts for the significantly right-skewed distributions of career longevity and achievement in science. Using this theoretical model, we show that short-term contracts can amplify the effects of competition and uncertainty making careers more vulnerable to early termination, not necessarily due to lack of individual talent and persistence, but because of random negative production shocks. We show that fluctuations in scientific production are quantitatively related to a scientist’s collaboration radius and team efficiency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Petersen","given":"Alexander M."},{"family":"Riccaboni","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Stanley","given":"H.

  {"id":"petitjeanDynamicTimeWarping2014","abstract":"Recent years have seen significant progress in improving both the efficiency and effectiveness of time series classification. However, because the best solution is typically the Nearest Neighbor algorithm with the relatively expensive Dynamic Time Warping as the distance measure, successful deployments on resource constrained devices remain elusive. Moreover, the recent explosion of interest in wearable devices, which typically have limited computational resources, has created a growing need for very efficient classification algorithms. A commonly used technique to glean the benefits of the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, without inheriting its undesirable time complexity, is to use the Nearest Centroid algorithm. However, because of the unique properties of (most) time series data, the centroid typically does not resemble any of the instances, an unintuitive and underappreciated fact. In this work we show that we can exploit a recent result to allow meaningful averaging of 'warped' times series, and that this result allows us to create ultra-efficient Nearest 'Centroid' classifiers that are at least as accurate as their more lethargic Nearest Neighbor cousins.","author":[{"family":"Petitjean","given":"F."},{"family":"Forestier","given":"G."},{"family":"Webb","given":"G.

  {"id":"pfefferWealthInequalityNations2021","abstract":"Comparative research on income inequality has produced several frameworks to study the institutional determinants of income stratification. In contrast, no such framework and much less empirical evidence exist to explain cross-national differences in wealth inequality. This situation is particularly lamentable as cross-national patterns of inequality in wealth diverge sharply from those in income. We seek to pave the way for new explanations of cross-national differences in wealth inequality by tracing them to the influence of different wealth components. Drawing on the literatures on financialization and housing, we argue that housing equity should be the central building block of the comparative analysis of wealth inequality. Using harmonized data on 15 countries included in the Luxembourg Wealth Study (LWS), we demonstrate a lack of association between national levels of income and wealth inequality and concentration. Using decomposition approaches, we then estimate the degree to which national levels of wealth inequality and concentration relate to cross-national differences in wealth portfolios and the distribution of specific asset components. Considering the role of housing equity, financial assets, non-housing real assets, and non-housing debt, we show that cross-national variation in wealth inequality and concentration is centrally determined by the distribution of housing equity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Pfeffer","given":"Fabian T."},{"family":"Waitkus","given":"Nora"}],"citation-key":"pfefferWealthInequalityNations2021","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/00031224211027800","ISSN":"0003-1224","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,30]]},"language":"en","page":"00031224211027800","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Wealth Inequality of Nations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224211027800"},

  {"id":"piersonPoliticsTimeHistory2004","abstract":"This groundbreaking book represents the most systematic examination to date of the often-invoked but rarely examined declaration that \"history matters.\" Most contemporary social scientists unconsciously take a \"snapshot\" view of the social world. Yet the meaning of social events or processes is frequently distorted when they are ripped from their temporal context. Paul Pierson argues that placing politics in time--constructing \"moving pictures\" rather than snapshots--can vastly enrich our understanding of complex social dynamics, and greatly improve the theories and methods that we use to explain them.Politics in Time opens a new window on the temporal aspects of the social world. It explores a range of important features and implications of evolving social processes: the variety of processes that unfold over significant periods of time, the circumstances under which such different processes are likely to occur, and above all, the significance of these temporal dimensions of social life for our understanding of important political and social outcomes. Ranging widely across the social sciences, Pierson's analysis reveals the high price social science pays when it becomes ahistorical. And it provides a wealth of ideas for restoring our sense of historical process. By placing politics back in time, Pierson's book is destined to have a resounding and enduring impact on the work of scholars and students in fields from political science, history, and sociology to economics and policy analysis.","author":[{"family":"Pierson","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"piersonPoliticsTimeHistory2004","event-place":"Princeton","ISBN":"0-691-11715-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"212","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton","source":"Google Books","title":"Politics in Time: History, Institutions, and Social Analysis","title-short":"Politics in Time","type":"book"},
  {"id":"pikettyCapitalBackWealthincome2014","abstract":"How do aggregate wealth-to-income ratios evolve in the long run and why? We address this question using 1970–2010 national balance sheets recently compiled in the top eight developed economies. For the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and France, we are able to extend our analysis as far back as 1700. We find in every country a gradual rise` of wealth-income ratios in recent decades, from about 200–300% in 1970 to 400–600% in 2010. In effect, today’s ratios appear to be returning to the high values observed in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (600–700%). This can be explained by a long-run asset price recovery (itself driven by changes in capital policies since the world wars) and by the slowdown of productivity and population growth, in line with the β=sgβ=sg Harrod-Domar-Solow formula. That is, for a given net saving rate s = 10%, the long-run wealth-income ratio β is about 300% if g = 3% and 600% if g = 1.5%. Our results have implications for capital taxation and regulation and shed new light on the changing nature of wealth, the shape of the production function, and the rise of capital shares.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Piketty","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Zucman","given":"Gabriel"}],"citation-key":"pikettyCapitalBackWealthincome2014","container-title":"The Quarterly Journal of Economics","ISSN":"0033-5533","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"1255-1310","source":"eprints.lse.ac.uk","title":"Capital is back: wealth-income ratios in rich countries 1700-2010","title-short":"Capital is back","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.oxfordjournals.org/en/","volume":"129"},

  {"id":"pluchinoPeterPrincipleRevisited2010","abstract":"In the late sixties the Canadian psychologist Laurence J. Peter advanced an apparently paradoxical principle, named since then after him, which can be summarized as follows: ‘Every new member in a hierarchical organization climbs the hierarchy until he/she reaches his/her level of maximum incompetence’. Despite its apparent unreasonableness, such a principle would realistically act in any organization where the mechanism of promotion rewards the best members and where the competence at their new level in the hierarchical structure does not depend on the competence they had at the previous level, usually because the tasks of the levels are very different to each other. Here we show, by means of agent based simulations, that if the latter two features actually hold in a given model of an organization with a hierarchical structure, then not only is the Peter principle unavoidable, but also it yields in turn a significant reduction of the global efficiency of the organization. Within a game theory-like approach, we explore different promotion strategies and we find, counterintuitively, that in order to avoid such an effect the best ways for improving the efficiency of a given organization are either to promote each time an agent at random or to promote randomly the best and the worst members in terms of competence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Pluchino","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Rapisarda","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Garofalo","given":"Cesare"}],"citation-key":"pluchinoPeterPrincipleRevisited2010","container-title":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","container-title-short":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","DOI":"10.1016/j.physa.2009.09.045","ISSN":"0378-4371","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,2,1]]},"page":"467-472","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The Peter principle revisited: A computational study","title-short":"The Peter principle revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037843710900822X","volume":"389"},

This paper contributes by exploring the corporate archive as a source of contestation shaped by the varying degrees of power and interest held by key stakeholders.

We develop a network approach to organizational learning and derive firm-level, longitudinal hypotheses that link research and development alliances, experience with managing interfirm relationships, network position, rates of growth, and portfolios of collaborative activities. We test these hypotheses on a sample of dedicated biotechnology firms in the years 1990-1994.

Four alternative logics of attachment—accumulative advantage, homophily, follow‐the‐trend, and multiconnectivity—are tested to explain the structure and dynamics of interorganizational collaboration in biotechnology. Using multiple novel methods, the authors demonstrate how different rules for affiliation shape network evolution. Commercialization strategies pursued by early corporate entrants are supplanted by universities, research institutes, venture capital, and small firms. As organizations increase their collaborative activities and diversify their ties to others, cohesive subnetworks form, characterized by multiple, independent pathways. These structural components, in turn, condition the choices and opportunities available to members of a field, thereby reinforcing an attachment logic based on differential connections to diverse partners.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Powell","given":"Walter W."},{"family":"White","given":"Douglas R."},{"family":"Koput","given":"Kenneth W."},{"family":"Owen‐Smith","given":"Jason"}],"citation-key":"powellNetworkDynamicsField2005a","container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","container-title-short":"American Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1086/421508","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,1,1]]},"page":"1132-1205","source":"JSTOR","title":"Network Dynamics and Field Evolution: The Growth of Interorganizational Collaboration in the Life Sciences","title-short":"Network Dynamics and Field Evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/421508","volume":"110"},

In addition to financial audits there are now medical audits, technology audits, value for money audits, environmental audits, quality audits, teaching audits, and many others. Why has this happened? What does it mean when a society invests so heavily in an industry of checking and when more and more individuals find themselves subject to formal scrutiny? The Audit Society argues that the rise of auditing has its roots in political demands for accountability and control. At the heart of a new administrative style internal control systems have begun to play an important public role and individual and organizational performance has been increasingly formalized and made auditable. Michael Power argues that the new demands and expectations of audits live uneasily with their operational capabilities. Not only is the manner in which they produce assurance and accountability open to question but also, by imposing their own values, audits often have unintended and dysfunctional consequences for the audited organization.","author":[{"family":"Power","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"powerAuditSocietyRituals1999","event-place":"Oxford, New York","ISBN":"978-0-19-829603-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,8,19]]},"number-of-pages":"208","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford, New York","source":"Oxford University Press","title":"The Audit Society: Rituals of Verification","title-short":"The Audit Society","type":"book"},

But why did neoliberal policies gain such prominence in these two countries and not in similarly industrialized Western countries such as France and Germany?In The Politics of Free Markets, a comparative-historical analysis of the development of neoliberal policies in these four countries, Monica Prasad argues that neoliberalism was made possible in the United States and Britain not because the Left in these countries was too weak, but because it was in some respects too strong. At the time of the oil crisis in the 1970s, American and British tax policies were more punitive to business and the wealthy than the tax policies of France and West Germany; American and British industrial policies were more adversarial to business in key domains; and while the British welfare state was the most redistributive of the four, the French welfare state was the least redistributive. Prasad shows that these adversarial structures in the United States and Britain created opportunities for politicians to find and mobilize dissatisfaction with the status quo, while the more progrowth policies of France and West Germany prevented politicians of the Right from anchoring neoliberalism in electoral dissatisfaction.","author":[{"family":"Prasad","given":"Monica"}],"citation-key":"prasadPoliticsFreeMarkets2006","ISBN":"978-0-226-67902-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,7,17]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"339","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Politics of Free Markets: The Rise of Neoliberal Economic Policies in Britain, France, Germany, and the United States","title-short":"The Politics of Free Markets","type":"book"},

  {"id":"predaFramingFinanceBoundaries2009","abstract":"As the banking crisis and its effects on the world economy have made plain, the stock market is of colossal importance to our livelihoods. In Framing Finance, Alex Preda looks at the history of the market to figure out how we arrived at a point where investing is not only commonplace, but critical, as market fluctuations threaten our plans to send our children to college or retire comfortably. As Preda discovers through extensive research, the public was once much more skeptical. For investing to become accepted, a deep-seated prejudice against speculation had to be overcome, and Preda reveals that over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries groups associated with stock exchanges in New York, London, and Paris managed to redefine finance as a scientific pursuit grounded in observational technology. But Preda also notes that as the financial data in which they trafficked became ever more difficult to understand, charismatic speculators emerged whose manipulations of the market undermined the benefits of widespread investment. And so, Framing Finance ends with an eye on the future, proposing a system of public financial education to counter the irrational elements that still animate the appeal of finance.","author":[{"family":"Preda","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"predaFramingFinanceBoundaries2009","ISBN":"978-0-226-67933-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,8,1]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"328","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Framing Finance: The Boundaries of Markets and Modern Capitalism","title-short":"Framing Finance","type":"book"},
  {"id":"predaSociologicalApproachFinancial2007","abstract":"Abstract As a part of the renaissance and growth of economic sociology during the past two decades, and in response to processes such as economic globalization, financial markets have been increasingly scrutinized by sociologists. Their investigation is seen as relevant with respect to understanding the structure and dynamics of advanced societies, the dynamics of social development, as well as fundamental aspects of human behaviour. This paper charts recent developments in the sociology of financial markets; its starting point is the treatment of the concept of information within three sociological orientations: the social-structural approach, sociological neo-institutionalism and the newer social studies of finance. By highlighting their different assumptions about information and market behaviour, I discuss how these approaches conceptualize financial markets, the methodological implications and the ways in which they contribute to the study of financial exchanges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,7,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Preda","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"predaSociologicalApproachFinancial2007","container-title":"Journal of Economic Surveys","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-6419.2007.00512.x","ISSN":"1467-6419","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"506-533","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Sociological Approach to Financial Markets","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6419.2007.00512.x/abstract","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"preisQuantifyingBehaviorStock2012","abstract":"Understanding correlations in complex systems is crucial in the face of turbulence, such as the ongoing financial crisis. However, in complex systems, such as financial systems, correlations are not constant but instead vary in time. Here we address the question of quantifying state-dependent correlations in stock markets. Reliable estimates of correlations are absolutely necessary to protect a portfolio. We analyze 72 years of daily closing prices of the 30 stocks forming the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). We find the striking result that the average correlation among these stocks scales linearly with market stress reflected by normalized DJIA index returns on various time scales. Consequently, the diversification effect which should protect a portfolio melts away in times of market losses, just when it would most urgently be needed. Our empirical analysis is consistent with the interesting possibility that one could anticipate diversification breakdowns, guiding the design of protected portfolios.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Preis","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Kenett","given":"Dror Y."},{"family":"Stanley","given":"H.

  {"id":"preisSwitchingProcessesFinancial2011","abstract":"For an intriguing variety of switching processes in nature, the underlying complex system abruptly changes from one state to another in a highly discontinuous fashion. Financial market fluctuations are characterized by many abrupt switchings creating upward trends and downward trends, on time scales ranging from macroscopic trends persisting for hundreds of days to microscopic trends persisting for a few minutes. The question arises whether these ubiquitous switching processes have quantifiable features independent of the time horizon studied. We find striking scale-free behavior of the transaction volume after each switching. Our findings can be interpreted as being consistent with time-dependent collective behavior of financial market participants. We test the possible universality of our result by performing a parallel analysis of fluctuations in time intervals between transactions. We suggest that the well known catastrophic bubbles that occur on large time scales—such as the most recent financial crisis—may not be outliers but single dramatic representatives caused by the formation of increasing and decreasing trends on time scales varying over nine orders of magnitude from very large down to very small.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Preis","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Johannes J."},{"family":"Stanley","given":"H.

An important limitation of much of this research, however, is that risk factors are not studied in comparison with one another or from across different fields of research.

In the current investigation, we compare 57 factors within a multidisciplinary framework. These include (<i>i</i>) adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial experiences during childhood and (<i>ii</i>) socioeconomic conditions, (<i>iii</i>) health behaviors, (<i>iv</i>) social connections, (<i>v</i>) psychological characteristics, and (<i>vi</i>) adverse experiences during adulthood. The current prospective cohort investigation with 13,611 adults from 52 to 104 y of age (mean age 69.3 y) from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study used weighted traditional (i.e., multivariate Cox regressions) and machine-learning (i.e., lasso, random forest analysis) statistical approaches to identify the leading predictors of mortality over 6 y of follow-up time. We demonstrate that, in addition to the well-established behavioral risk factors of smoking, alcohol abuse, and lack of physical activity, economic (e.g., recent financial difficulties, unemployment history), social (e.g., childhood adversity, divorce history), and psychological (e.g., negative affectivity) factors were also among the strongest predictors of mortality among older American adults. The strength of these predictors should be used to guide future transdisciplinary investigations and intervention studies across the fields of epidemiology, psychology, sociology, economics, and medicine to understand how changes in these factors alter individual mortality risk.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Puterman","given":"Eli"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Jordan"},{"family":"Hives","given":"Benjamin A."},{"family":"Gemmill","given":"Alison"},{"family":"Karasek","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Mendes","given":"Wendy Berry"},{"family":"Rehkopf","given":"David H."}],"citation-key":"putermanPredictingMortality572020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1918455117","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,17]]},"language":"en","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Predicting mortality from 57 economic, behavioral, social, and psychological factors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/06/16/1918455117"},

The largest crash in the past decades is the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers which was followed by a trust-based crisis between banks due to high-risk trading in complex products. We introduce information dissipation length (IDL) as a leading indicator of global instability of dynamical systems based on the transmission of Shannon information, and apply it to the time series of USD and EUR interest rate swaps (IRS). We find in both markets that the IDL steadily increases toward the bankruptcy, then peaks at the time of bankruptcy, and decreases afterwards. Previously introduced indicators such as ‘critical slowing down' do not provide a clear leading indicator. Our results suggest that the IDL may be used as an early-warning signal for critical transitions even in the absence of a predictive model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Quax","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Kandhai","given":"Drona"},{"family":"Sloot","given":"Peter M.

The third generation, starting to emerge in the late 1980s, deals with data that do not fall easily into either of these categories, either because they have a different form, such as texts or narratives, or because dependence is a crucial aspect, as with spatial or social network data.

  {"id":"rahmanInvisibleCageWorkers2021","abstract":"Existing research has shown that people experience third-party evaluations as a form of control because they try to align their behavior with evaluations’ criteria to secure more favorable resources, recognition, and opportunities from external audiences. Much of this research has focused on evaluations with transparent criteria, but increasingly, algorithmic evaluation systems are not transparent. Drawing on over three years of interviews, archival data, and observations as a registered user on a labor platform, I studied how freelance workers contend with an opaque third-party evaluation algorithm—and with what consequences. My findings show the platform implemented an opaque evaluation algorithm to meaningfully differentiate between freelancers’ rating scores. Freelancers experienced this evaluation as a form of control but could not align their actions with its criteria because they could not clearly identify those criteria. I found freelancers had divergent responses to this situation: some experimented with ways to improve their rating scores, and others constrained their activity on the platform. Their reactivity differed based not only on their general success on the platform—whether they were high or low performers—but also on how much they depended on the platform for work and whether they experienced setbacks in the form of decreased evaluation scores. These workers experienced what I call an “invisible cage”: a form of control in which the criteria for success and changes to those criteria are unpredictable. For gig workers who rely on labor platforms, this form of control increasingly determines their access to clients and projects while undermining their ability to understand and respond to factors that determine their success.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Rahman","given":"Hatim A."}],"citation-key":"rahmanInvisibleCageWorkers2021","container-title":"Administrative Science Quarterly","container-title-short":"Administrative Science Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/00018392211010118","ISSN":"0001-8392","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"945-988","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Invisible Cage: Workers’ Reactivity to Opaque Algorithmic Evaluations","title-short":"The Invisible Cage","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00018392211010118","volume":"66"},

  {"id":"randDynamicSocialNetworks2011","abstract":"Human populations are both highly cooperative and highly organized. Human interactions are not random but rather are structured in social networks. Importantly, ties in these networks often are dynamic, changing in response to the behavior of one's social partners. This dynamic structure permits an important form of conditional action that has been explored theoretically but has received little empirical attention: People can respond to the cooperation and defection of those around them by making or breaking network links. Here, we present experimental evidence of the power of using strategic link formation and dissolution, and the network modification it entails, to stabilize cooperation in sizable groups. Our experiments explore large-scale cooperation, where subjects’ cooperative actions are equally beneficial to all those with whom they interact. Consistent with previous research, we find that cooperation decays over time when social networks are shuffled randomly every round or are fixed across all rounds. We also find that, when networks are dynamic but are updated only infrequently, cooperation again fails. However, when subjects can update their network connections frequently, we see a qualitatively different outcome: Cooperation is maintained at a high level through network rewiring. Subjects preferentially break links with defectors and form new links with cooperators, creating an incentive to cooperate and leading to substantial changes in network structure. Our experiments confirm the predictions of a set of evolutionary game theoretic models and demonstrate the important role that dynamic social networks can play in supporting large-scale human cooperation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Rand","given":"David G."},{"family":"Arbesman","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Christakis","given":"Nicholas A."}],"citation-key":"randDynamicSocialNetworks2011","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1108243108","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"48","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,11,29]]},"language":"en","page":"19193-19198","PMID":"22084103","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Social Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Dynamic social networks promote cooperation in experiments with humans","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/108/48/19193","volume":"108"},
  {"id":"randPositiveInteractionsPromote2009","abstract":"The public goods game is the classic laboratory paradigm for studying collective action problems. Each participant chooses how much to contribute to a common pool that returns benefits to all participants equally. The ideal outcome occurs if everybody contributes the maximum amount, but the self-interested strategy is not to contribute anything. Most previous studies have found punishment to be more effective than reward for maintaining cooperation in public goods games. The typical design of these studies, however, represses future consequences for today’s actions. In an experimental setting, we compare public goods games followed by punishment, reward, or both in the setting of truly repeated games, in which player identities persist from round to round. We show that reward is as effective as punishment for maintaining public cooperation and leads to higher total earnings. Moreover, when both options are available, reward leads to increased contributions and payoff, whereas punishment has no effect on contributions and leads to lower payoff. We conclude that reward outperforms punishment in repeated public goods games and that human cooperation in such repeated settings is best supported by positive interactions with others.\nReward is as good as punishment to promote cooperation, costs less, and increases the share out of resources up for grabs.\nReward is as good as punishment to promote cooperation, costs less, and increases the share out of resources up for grabs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Rand","given":"David G."},{"family":"Dreber","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Ellingsen","given":"Tore"},{"family":"Fudenberg","given":"Drew"},{"family":"Nowak","given":"Martin A."}],"citation-key":"randPositiveInteractionsPromote2009","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.1177418","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"5945","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,9,4]]},"language":"en","page":"1272-1275","PMID":"19729661","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"Positive Interactions Promote Public Cooperation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/325/5945/1272","volume":"325"},

It goes back to World War II to recover a wartime narrative context through which sociologists formulated a ‘trauma’ to the discipline and ‘blamed’ qualitative and values-oriented research for damaging the scientific status of sociology. This narrative documents a discussion of the changes that sociologists said needed to be made in sociology as a science to repair its status and reputation. While debates among sociologists about theory and method had always been contentious, the wartime narrative insisted for the first time that sociology be immediately unified around quantitative approaches. The narrative of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ science that developed during the war not only undermined the efforts of social interactionists to theorize social action and social justice, but also derailed Parsons’ pre-war effort to bridge differences. The moral coding that is the legacy of the narrative stigmatized important approaches to sociology, leading to a ‘crisis’ in the 1960s that still haunts the discipline. Disciplinary history has overlooked the wartime narrative with the result that the role played by World War II in effecting this crisis has gone unrecognized.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Rawls","given":"Anne Warfield"}],"citation-key":"rawlsWartimeNarrativeUS2018","container-title":"European Journal of Social Theory","container-title-short":"European Journal of Social Theory","DOI":"10.1177/1368431018754499","ISSN":"1368-4310","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"526-546","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The wartime narrative in US sociology, 1940–1947: stigmatizing qualitative sociology in the name of ‘science’","title-short":"The wartime narrative in US sociology, 1940–1947","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1368431018754499","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"rijsewijkDescriptionClassroomHelp2018","abstract":"This study examined how classroom peer relations can be described in terms of the network of help relations among students, and the positions students take up in this help network, and whether the structure of adolescent classroom help networks and individual network positions were associated with academic achievement. Help networks were based on the peer nomination question \"Who helps you with problems?\" Building on previous studies on classroom climate and individual network position, higher academic achievement was expected in classrooms with: a dense help network; no or a few network isolates (referring to students that did not give or receive help at all); less segmentation in help relations; equally distributed help nominations. In addition, higher achievement was expected for individuals with more helpers and a more central position in the help network. Using the Dutch SNARE data (54 classrooms; 1,144 students), the multilevel models suggested that lower achievement was related to an unequal distribution of help relations in a classroom. Moreover, the centrality of individuals in the help network was linked to higher achievement. Classrooms varied strongly on network dimensions, and networks that would theoretically be expected to be most beneficial for achievement (with high density, a few isolates, low segmentation, and high equality) turned out to be highly uncommon. The findings demonstrated that subtle network processes were relevant for academic success, and that classroom network characteristics are associated with classroom-level variation in academic achievement. Descriptive results underlined the complexity of the social context of classrooms, and the absence of 'beneficial' classrooms suggests that researchers should adjust their notion of what is a beneficial or detrimental classroom environment for adolescents.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Rijsewijk","given":"Louise Gerharda Maria","dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Oldenburg","given":"Beau"},{"family":"Snijders","given":"Tom Augustinus Benedictus"},{"family":"Dijkstra","given":"Jan Kornelis"},{"family":"Veenstra","given":"René"}],"citation-key":"rijsewijkDescriptionClassroomHelp2018","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0208173","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12,19]]},"language":"en","page":"e0208173","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"A description of classroom help networks, individual network position, and their associations with academic achievement","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208173","volume":"13"},

Using survey data from over 400 science and engineering PhD students, we examine the extent to which PhD students’ taste for science (e.g., desire for independence, publishing, peer recognition, and interest in basic research) and other individual characteristics predict preferences for research careers in industry versus academia. Our results suggest that PhD students who prefer industrial employment show a weaker “taste for science”, a greater concern for salary and access to resources, and a stronger interest in downstream work compared to PhD students who prefer an academic career.

Social scientists often want to move beyond exploration, to measurement and experimentation, and make inference about social and political processes that drive discourse and content. In this article, we develop a model of text data that supports this type of substantive research. Our approach is to posit a hierarchical mixed membership model for analyzing topical content of documents, in which mixing weights are parameterized by observed covariates. In this model, topical prevalence and topical content are specified as a simple generalized linear model on an arbitrary number of document-level covariates, such as news source and time of release, enabling researchers to introduce elements of the experimental design that informed document collection into the model, within a generally applicable framework. We demonstrate the proposed methodology by analyzing a collection of news reports about China, where we allow the prevalence of topics to evolve over time and vary across newswire services. Our methods quantify the effect of news wire source on both the frequency and nature of topic coverage.

A crucial contribution of the method is that it incorporates information about the document, such as the author's gender, political affiliation, and treatment assignment (if an experimental study). This article focuses on how the STM is helpful for survey researchers and experimentalists. The STM makes analyzing open-ended responses easier, more revealing, and capable of being used to estimate treatment effects.

Examples of different dependence assumptions and their associated models are given, including Bernoulli, dyad-independent and Markov random graph models. The incorporation of actor attributes in social selection models is also reviewed. Newer, more complex dependence assumptions are briefly outlined. Estimation procedures are discussed, including new methods for Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation. We foreshadow the discussion taken up in other papers in this special edition: that the homogeneous Markov random graph models of Frank and Strauss [Frank, O., Strauss, D., 1986. Markov graphs. Journal of the American Statistical Association 81, 832–842] are not appropriate for many observed networks, whereas the new model specifications of Snijders et al.

  {"id":"rodmanTimelyInterventionTracking2020","abstract":"Word vectorization is an emerging text-as-data method that shows great promise for automating the analysis of semantics—here, the cultural meanings of words—in large volumes of text. Yet successes with this method have largely been confined to massive corpora where the meanings of words are presumed to be fixed. In political science applications, however, many corpora are comparatively small and many interesting questions hinge on the recognition that meaning changes over time. Together, these two facts raise vexing methodological challenges. Can word vectors trace the changing cultural meanings of words in typical small corpora use cases? I test four time-sensitive implementations of word vectors (word2vec) against a gold standard developed from a modest data set of 161 years of newspaper coverage. I find that one implementation method clearly outperforms the others in matching human assessments of how public dialogues around equality in America have changed over time. In addition, I suggest best practices for using word2vec to study small corpora for time series questions, including bootstrap resampling of documents and pretraining of vectors. I close by showing that word2vec allows granular analysis of the changing meaning of words, an advance over other common text-as-data methods for semantic research questions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Rodman","given":"Emma"}],"citation-key":"rodmanTimelyInterventionTracking2020","container-title":"Political Analysis","DOI":"10.1017/pan.2019.23","ISSN":"1047-1987, 1476-4989","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1]]},"language":"en","page":"87-111","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"A Timely Intervention: Tracking the Changing Meanings of Political Concepts with Word Vectors","title-short":"A Timely Intervention","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/timely-intervention-tracking-the-changing-meanings-of-political-concepts-with-word-vectors/DDF3B5833A12E673EEE24FBD9798679E","volume":"28"},

The coauthorship network was created from the bibliographic record of a multi-institution, interdisciplinary research group focused on the study of sensor networks and wireless communication. Four different community detection algorithms were employed to assign a structural community to each scholar in the network: leading eigenvector, walktrap, edge betweenness and spinglass. Socioacademic characteristics were gathered from the scholars and include such information as their academic department, academic affiliation, country of origin, and academic position. A Pearson’s χ 2 test, with a simulated Monte Carlo, revealed that structural communities best represent groupings of individuals working in the same academic department and at the same institution. A generalization of this result suggests that, even in interdisciplinary, multi-institutional research groups, coauthorship is primarily driven by departmental and institutional affiliation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Rodriguez","given":"Marko A."},{"family":"Pepe","given":"Alberto"}],"citation-key":"rodriguezRelationshipStructuralSocioacademic2008","container-title":"Journal of Informetrics","DOI":"10.1016/j.joi.2008.04.002","ISSN":"1751-1577","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,7]]},"page":"195-201","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"On the relationship between the structural and socioacademic communities of a coauthorship network","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157708000230","volume":"2"},

A model that is becoming increasingly popular for modeling association between recurrent survival times is the use of a frailty model. In recent years a number of papers appeared, extending the survival models to models that are suitable to handle more complex survival data as recurrent events. We present here frailty model extensions to analyze recurrent events data: cure frailty models for a mixture of susceptible and insusceptible subjects for the event of interest; nested frailty models when data are clustered at several hierarchical levels and joint frailty models for the joint analysis of recurrent events and death. We performed a semi-parametric penalized likelihood approach to estimate the different parameters. Those different models can be fitted using the R package “frailtypack”.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Rondeau","given":"V."}],"citation-key":"rondeauStatisticalModelsRecurrent2010","collection-title":"Mathematical Models in Medicine, Business & Engineering 2009","container-title":"Mathematical and Computer Modelling","container-title-short":"Mathematical and Computer Modelling","DOI":"10.1016/j.mcm.2010.02.002","ISSN":"0895-7177","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,10,1]]},"page":"949-955","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Statistical models for recurrent events and death: Application to cancer events","title-short":"Statistical models for recurrent events and death","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895717710000439","volume":"52"},

  {"id":"rosenRacialDiscriminationHousing2021","abstract":"An extensive literature documents racial discrimination in housing, focusing on its prevalence and effect on non-White populations. This article studies how such discrimination operates, and the intermediaries who engage in it: landlords. A fundamental assumption of racial discrimination research is that gatekeepers such as landlords are confronted with a racially heterogeneous applicant pool. The reality of urban housing markets, however, is that historical patterns of residential segregation intersect with other structural barriers to drive selection into the applicant pool, such that landlords are more often selecting between same-race applicants. Using interviews and observations with 157 landlords in four cities, we ask: how do landlords construct their tenants’ race within racially segmented housing markets, and how does this factor into their screening processes? We find that landlords distinguish between tenants based on the degree to which their behavior conforms to insidious cultural narratives at the intersection of race, gender, and class. Landlords with large portfolios rely on screening algorithms, whereas mom-and-pop landlords make decisions based on informal mechanisms such as “gut feelings,” home visits, and the presentation of children. Landlords may put aside certain racial prejudices when they have the right financial incentives, but only when the tenant also defies stereotypes. In this way, landlords’ intersectional construction of race—even within a predominantly Black or Latino tenant pool—limits residential options for low-income, subsidized tenants of color, burdening their search process. These findings have implications for how we understand racial discrimination within racially homogenous social spheres. Examining landlords’ screening practices offers insight into the role housing plays in how racism continues to shape life outcomes—both explicitly through overt racial bias, and increasingly more covertly, through algorithmic automation and digital technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosen","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Garboden","given":"Philip M.

  {"id":"rossierAccumulationConversionCapitals2020","abstract":"This paper studies the different biographic pathways to an economics and business studies professor position between 1957 and 2000 on the specific case of Switzerland. It focuses on the accumulation and conversion of capitals during academic trajectories, and their relation to three types of resources: scientific reputation, network relations, and internationality. Based on an original biographical database of 411 professors and an innovative use of sequence analysis and multinomial logistic regression, it shows that the three main principles of career structuration divide them between (1) academic and extra-academic trajectories, (2) “standard” positions and executive positions in influent academic organizations, and (3) according to the timing of the accession to a professor position (“early” vs. “slower” appointments). It also shows that careers are increasingly academic between 1957 and 2000. Academic only and long full professor trajectories are linked to reputation in the scientific field (through citations in “prestigious” journals) and internationality of the professors’ profile, while an earlier appointment as professor is associated to developed scientific collaboration networks. Relatively long careers in executive positions in influent academic organizations are linked to important connections to economic, political, and administrative “elite” members (through the supervision of their PhD) as well as scientific expertise for the state, while extra-academic careers only lead to subordinate (associate) professor positions and no detention of other resources within economics and business studies whatsoever.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Rossier","given":"Thierry"}],"citation-key":"rossierAccumulationConversionCapitals2020","container-title":"Higher Education","container-title-short":"High Educ","DOI":"10.1007/s10734-020-00508-3","ISSN":"1573-174X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1061-1080","source":"Springer Link","title":"Accumulation and conversion of capitals in professorial careers.

Mangelernährung). Bei steigendem Pflegebedarf (und Verfall des ökonomischen, kulturellen und sozialen Kapitals der Pflegebedürftigen) nimmt die Qualität der Pflege ab, und es herrscht insgesamt eine wenig systematische, mangelhafte Pflege, die mit Überversorgung, Infantilisierung und Paternalismus oder gar Gewalt einhergeht. Die Hintergründe der strukturellen Probleme bleiben eher im Dunkeln — auch infolge scheinbar auf der Hand liegender Erklärung sansätze und theoretischer Annahmen. Die an Ressourcenmangel und Überlastung sowie Qualifikations-und Organisationsdefiziten ansetzenden funktionalistischen Konzepte einerseits und interpretative sowie institutionenkritische Ansätze andererseits reichen — trotz gewisser empirischer Evidenz — nicht aus, die Dilemmata des prekären sozialen Feldes Altenpflege zu verstehen. Der Aufsatz leistet einen Beitrag zur Klärung der Dilemmata unter Rückgriff auf die Feldtheorie von Bourdieu. Das heteronome Feld der Altenpflege — verortet im Spannungsverhältnis von Lebenswelt, Familie und Medizin — ist stark durch unterschiedlich (wesentlich durch die Geschlechterordnung) bedingte soziale Ungleichheiten und verkannte Machtstrukturen sowie Konflikte geprägt und geht einher mit einem disparaten, bisher wenig reflektierten Habitus der Pflegenden („Schwestern“). , Abstract The article initially deals with descriptive findings of serious deficits in the professional and institutional handling of the risks faced by elderly people needing care (e.g. malnutrition). Especially with the increasing need for care (and with the decline of their economic, cultural and social capital), these people are suffering a deteriorating quality of care, and on the whole, a rather unsystematic and unsatisfactory care situation prevails, with over-provision of care, infantilization, paternalism or even violence. In general, the background of the structural problems remains quite unexplained, which is also due to the prevalence of seemingly obvious explanations and theoretical assumptions. In spite of some empirical evidence, neither functionalist concepts that focus on both the lack of resources and overburden and on deficits in qualification and organisation nor interpretative approaches that are critical of institutions will help to understand the dilemmas of the precarious social field of the care of the elderly. These dilemmas are elucidated by means of Bourdieu’s field theory. The heteronomous field in the area of conflict between everyday life, family and medicine is strongly influenced by social inequality and unrecognised power structures with diverse causes (predominantly rooted in the order of the sexes), as well as by conflicts; and the dispositions (“Habitus”) of the nursing staff are disparate and have been paid little attention to up to now.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Roth","given":"Günter"}],"citation-key":"rothDilemmataAltenpflegeLogik2007","container-title":"Berliner Journal für Soziologie","container-title-short":"BJfS","DOI":"10.1007/s11609-007-0005-0","ISSN":"0863-1808, 1862-2593","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"de","page":"77-96","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Dilemmata der Altenpflege: Die Logik eines prekären sozialen Feldes","title-short":"Dilemmata der Altenpflege","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11609-007-0005-0","volume":"17"},

Here, we extend that research by examining the role of e-communications among day traders and their collective understanding of the market. Our study introduces a general method that focuses on bundles of words that behave differently from daily communication routines, and uses original data covering the content of instant messages among all day traders at a trading firm over a 40-month period. Analyses show that two word bundles convey traders' understanding of same day market events and potential next day market events. We find that when market volatility is high, traders' communications are dominated by same day events, and when volatility is low, communications are dominated by next day events. We show that the stronger the traders' attention to either same day or next day events, the higher their collective trading performance. We conclude that e-communication among traders is a product of mass collaboration over diverse viewpoints that embodies unique information about their weak or strong understanding of the market.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Saavedra","given":"Serguei"},{"family":"Duch","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"Uzzi","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"saavedraTrackingTradersUnderstanding2011","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0026705","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,10,25]]},"page":"e26705","source":"PLoS ONE","title":"Tracking Traders' Understanding of the Market Using e-Communication Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0026705","volume":"6"},

The current study thus examines and compares the research productivity of faculty members across disciplines and career stages. The research tests three life course theories (cumulative advantage, utility maximization theory and obsolescence theory) with data from eight disciplines (biology, computer sciences, mathematics/statistics, physical sciences, psychology, social sciences, engineering, and health fields). The data for this study are taken from the 2003 Survey of Doctorate Recipients. Unlike past studies, which solely use journal articles as a measure of research productivity, this study also takes into consideration publications in books and monographs. The study found that the majority of the research output (articles and books) produced in Health and Physical Sciences disciplines is by early and mid career faculty members, providing support for the obsolescence theory, which suggests that research performance declines as faculty members progress in their careers. Further, aging shifts the output mix more towards books for social scientists, making them the most productive group when books or monographs are taken as a measure of research productivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Sabharwal","given":"Meghna"}],"citation-key":"sabharwalComparingResearchProductivity2013","container-title":"Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis: Research and Practice","DOI":"10.1080/13876988.2013.785149","ISSN":"1387-6988","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,4,1]]},"page":"141-163","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Comparing Research Productivity Across Disciplines and Career Stages","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13876988.2013.785149","volume":"15"},

We investigated this question with a scientific mass collaboration using the common task method; 160 teams built predictive models for six life outcomes using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a high-quality birth cohort study. Despite using a rich dataset and applying machine-learning methods optimized for prediction, the best predictions were not very accurate and were only slightly better than those from a simple benchmark model. Within each outcome, prediction error was strongly associated with the family being predicted and weakly associated with the technique used to generate the prediction.

  {"id":"sallazBourdieuAmericanSociology2007","abstract":"Abstract This article traces the transatlantic diffusion of Pierre Bourdieu's ideas into American sociology. We find that rather than being received as abstract theory, Bourdieu has been actively put to use to generate new empirical research. In addition, American sociologists have used their findings to problematize and extend his theory. Bourdieu's sociology, in other words, has inspired a progressive research program in the United States. We trace this process in the two main forums for presenting research: journal articles and books. Content analysis of articles published in four major sociology journals reveals that, far from a recent fad, Bourdieu's ideas steadily diffused into American sociology between 1980 and 2004. Case studies of four influential books in turn illustrate how researchers have used Bourdieu's key concepts (capital, field, habitus, and symbolic power) to inform debates in four core subfields (political, economic, cultural, and urban sociology).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Sallaz","given":"Jeffrey J."},{"family":"Zavisca","given":"Jane"}],"citation-key":"sallazBourdieuAmericanSociology2007","container-title":"Annual Review of Sociology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131627","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"page":"21-41","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Bourdieu in American Sociology, 1980–2004","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131627","volume":"33"},

Our review identified over 40 relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals from the mid-1990s to 2001, the take-off point for an increasing level of interest in neighborhood effects. Moving beyond traditional characteristics such as concentrated poverty, we evaluate the salience of social-interactional and institutional mechanisms hypothesized to account for neighborhood-level variations in a variety of phenomena (e.g., delinquency, violence, depression, high-risk behavior), especially among adolescents. We highlight neighborhood ties, social control, mutual trust, institutional resources, disorder, and routine activity patterns. We also discuss a set of thorny methodological problems that plague the study of neighborhood effects, with special attention to selection bias. We conclude with promising strategies and directions for future research, including experimental designs, taking spatial and temporal dynamics seriously, systematic observational approaches, and benchmark data on neighborhood social processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Sampson","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Morenoff","given":"Jeffrey D."},{"family":"Gannon-Rowley","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"sampsonAssessingNeighborhoodEffects2002","container-title":"Annual Review of Sociology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.soc.28.110601.141114","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.28.110601.141114","page":"443-478","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Assessing “Neighborhood Effects”: Social Processes and New Directions in Research","title-short":"Assessing “Neighborhood Effects”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.28.110601.141114","volume":"28"},

Using survey data collected in 1995 from 8,782 Chicago residents, we examine variations in intergenerational closure, reciprocal local exchange, and shared expectations for informal social control across 342 neighborhoods. Adjusting for respondents' attributes, we assess the effects of neighborhood characteristics measured in the 1990 census and the role of spatial interdependence. The results show that residential stability and concentrated affluence, more so than poverty and racial/ethnic composition, predict intergenerational closure and reciprocal exchange. Concentrated disadvantage, by contrast, is associated with sharply lower expectations for shared child control. The importance of spatial dynamics in generating collective efficacy for children is highlighted-proximity to areas high in closure, exchange, and control bestows an advantage above and beyond the structural characteristics of a given neighborhood. Moreover, spatial advantages are much more likely to accrue to white neighborhoods than to black neighborhoods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,28]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Sampson","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Morenoff","given":"Jeffrey D."},{"family":"Earls","given":"Felton"}],"citation-key":"sampsonSocialCapitalSpatial1999","container-title":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.2307/2657367","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999]]},"page":"633-660","publisher":"[American Sociological Association, Sage Publications, Inc.]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Beyond Social Capital: Spatial Dynamics of Collective Efficacy for Children","title-short":"Beyond Social Capital","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657367","volume":"64"},

  {"id":"schellChangesFirearmMortality2020","abstract":"<p>Although 39,000 individuals die annually from gunshots in the US, research examining the effects of laws designed to reduce these deaths has sometimes produced inconclusive or contradictory findings. We evaluated the effects on total firearm-related deaths of three classes of gun laws: child access prevention (CAP), right-to-carry (RTC), and stand your ground (SYG) laws. The analyses exploit changes in these state-level policies from 1970 to 2016, using Bayesian methods and a modeling approach that addresses several methodological limitations of prior gun policy evaluations. CAP laws showed the strongest evidence of an association with firearm-related death rate, with a probability of 0.97 that the death rate declined at 6 y after implementation. In contrast, the probability of being associated with an increase in firearm-related deaths was 0.87 for RTC laws and 0.77 for SYG laws. The joint effects of these laws indicate that the restrictive gun policy regime (having a CAP law without an RTC or SYG law) has a 0.98 probability of being associated with a reduction in firearm-related deaths relative to the permissive policy regime. This estimated effect corresponds to an 11% reduction in firearm-related deaths relative to the permissive legal regime. Our findings suggest that a small but meaningful decrease in firearm-related deaths may be associated with the implementation of more restrictive gun policies.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Schell","given":"Terry L."},{"family":"Cefalu","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Griffin","given":"Beth Ann"},{"family":"Smart","given":"Rosanna"},{"family":"Morral","given":"Andrew R."}],"citation-key":"schellChangesFirearmMortality2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1921965117","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,10]]},"language":"en","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Changes in firearm mortality following the implementation of state laws regulating firearm access and use","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/06/09/1921965117"},

Why is there no mass exodus at such junctures? Why do most small investors practice ‘loyalty’ instead of ‘exit’ (Hirschman)? Even more importantly, why do they enter the financial market at all since its ‘hypercomplexity’ exposes them to an experience of confusion and helplessness? Behavioural economics provides some partial answers, but they remain too abstract and ahistorical and give a very reductionist picture of decision-making. In reaction to this incomplete understanding of the ‘loyalty’ puzzle, I will present two important explanatory factors from sociological reasoning: collectively shared stories as reducers of ‘hypercomplexity’ in which small investors’ decision-making is embedded, and the rebuilding of the welfare state, which forces more and more people to become small investors and stay in the market despite serious losses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Schimank","given":"Uwe"}],"citation-key":"schimankAllOddsLoyalty2011","container-title":"Socio-Economic Review","container-title-short":"Socioecon Rev","DOI":"10.1093/ser/mwq023","ISSN":"1475-1461, 1475-147X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"107-135","source":"ser.oxfordjournals.org","title":"Against all odds: the ‘loyalty’ of small investors","title-short":"Against all odds","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ser.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/1/107","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"schmidtFinancingPatternsMeasurement2004","abstract":"A widely recognized paper by Colin Mayer (1988) has led to a profound revision of academic thinking about financing patterns of corporations in different countries. Using flow-of-funds data instead of balance sheet data, Mayer and others who followed his lead found that internal financing is the dominant mode of financing in all countries, that financing patterns do not differ very much between countries and that those differences which still seem to exist are not at all consistent with the common conviction that financial systems can be classified as being either bank-based or capital market-based. This leads to a puzzle insofar as it calls into question the empirical foundation of the widely held belief that there is a correspondence between the financing patterns of corporations on the one side, and the structure of the financial sector and the prevailing corporate governance system in a given country on the other side.   The present paper addresses this puzzle on a methodological and an empirical basis. It starts by comparing and analyzing various ways of measuring financial structure and financing patterns and by demonstrating that the surprising empirical results found by studies that relied on net flows are due to a hidden assumption. It then derives an alternative method of measuring financing patterns, which also uses flow-of-funds data, but avoids the questionable assumption. This measurement concept is then applied to patterns of corporate financing in Germany, Japan and the United States. The empirical results, which use an estimation technique for determining gross flows of funds in those cases in which empirical data are not available, are very much in line with the commonly held belief prior to Mayer's influential contribution and indicate that the financial systems of the three countries do indeed differ from one another in a substantial way, and moreover in a way which is largely in line with the general view of the differences between the financial systems of the countries covered in the present paper.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Reinhard H."},{"family":"Hackethal","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"schmidtFinancingPatternsMeasurement2004","collection-title":"Frankfurt Dept. of Finance","event-place":"Frankfurt am Main","genre":"Working Paper Series: Finance & Accounting","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,1,1]]},"number":"125","page":"1-49","publisher":"Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universität","publisher-place":"Frankfurt am Main","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Financing Patterns: Measurement Concepts and Empirical Results","title-short":"Financing Patterns","type":"report","URL":"http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=254463"},

  {"id":"schonigerFindingRightBalance2015","abstract":"Groundwater modelers face the challenge of how to assign representative parameter values to the studied aquifer. Several approaches are available to parameterize spatial heterogeneity in aquifer parameters. They differ in their conceptualization and complexity, ranging from homogeneous models to heterogeneous random fields. While it is common practice to invest more effort into data collection for models with a finer resolution of heterogeneities, there is a lack of advice which amount of data is required to justify a certain level of model complexity. In this study, we propose to use concepts related to Bayesian model selection to identify this balance. We demonstrate our approach on the characterization of a heterogeneous aquifer via hydraulic tomography in a sandbox experiment (Illman et al., 2010). We consider four increasingly complex parameterizations of hydraulic conductivity: (1) Effective homogeneous medium, (2) geology-based zonation, (3) interpolation by pilot points, and (4) geostatistical random fields. First, we investigate the shift in justified complexity with increasing amount of available data by constructing a model confusion matrix. This matrix indicates the maximum level of complexity that can be justified given a specific experimental setup. Second, we determine which parameterization is most adequate given the observed drawdown data. Third, we test how the different parameterizations perform in a validation setup. The results of our test case indicate that aquifer characterization via hydraulic tomography does not necessarily require (or justify) a geostatistical description. Instead, a zonation-based model might be a more robust choice, but only if the zonation is geologically adequate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Schöniger","given":"Anneli"},{"family":"Illman","given":"Walter A."},{"family":"Wöhling","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Nowak","given":"Wolfgang"}],"citation-key":"schonigerFindingRightBalance2015","collection-title":"Groundwater flow and transport in aquifers: Insights from modeling and characterization at the field scale","container-title":"Journal of Hydrology","container-title-short":"Journal of Hydrology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.07.047","ISSN":"0022-1694","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"96-110","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Finding the right balance between groundwater model complexity and experimental effort via Bayesian model selection","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169415005533","volume":"531"},
  {"id":"schonigerModelSelectionSolid2014","abstract":"Bayesian model selection or averaging objectively ranks a number of plausible, competing conceptual models based on Bayes' theorem. It implicitly performs an optimal trade-off between performance in fitting available data and minimum model complexity. The procedure requires determining Bayesian model evidence (BME), which is the likelihood of the observed data integrated over each model's parameter space. The computation of this integral is highly challenging because it is as high-dimensional as the number of model parameters. Three classes of techniques to compute BME are available, each with its own challenges and limitations: (1) Exact and fast analytical solutions are limited by strong assumptions. (2) Numerical evaluation quickly becomes unfeasible for expensive models. (3) Approximations known as information criteria (ICs) such as the AIC, BIC, or KIC (Akaike, Bayesian, or Kashyap information criterion, respectively) yield contradicting results with regard to model ranking. Our study features a theory-based intercomparison of these techniques. We further assess their accuracy in a simplistic synthetic example where for some scenarios an exact analytical solution exists. In more challenging scenarios, we use a brute-force Monte Carlo integration method as reference. We continue this analysis with a real-world application of hydrological model selection. This is a first-time benchmarking of the various methods for BME evaluation against true solutions. Results show that BME values from ICs are often heavily biased and that the choice of approximation method substantially influences the accuracy of model ranking. For reliable model selection, bias-free numerical methods should be preferred over ICs whenever computationally feasible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Schöniger","given":"Anneli"},{"family":"Wöhling","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Samaniego","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Nowak","given":"Wolfgang"}],"citation-key":"schonigerModelSelectionSolid2014","container-title":"Water Resources Research","DOI":"10.1002/2014WR016062","ISSN":"1944-7973","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"9484-9513","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Model selection on solid ground: Rigorous comparison of nine ways to evaluate Bayesian model evidence","title-short":"Model selection on solid ground","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2014WR016062","volume":"50"},

  {"id":"schrootenStabilitatUndPerformance2010","abstract":"In Deutschland spielen Banken bei der Unternehmensfinanzierung eine herausragende Rolle. Vor der internationalen Finanzkrise galt der deutsche Bankensektor als stabil, aber renditeschwach. Vielfach wurde ihm im internationalen, aber auch im europäischen Vergleich eine geringe Performance bescheinigt. Seit langem gelten die Landesbanken als problematisch. Im Zuge der internationalen Finanzkrise wurde klar, dass die Stabilität des gesamten deutschen Bankensystems durch risikoreiche Geschäfte einzelner Kreditinstitute gefährdet werden kann. Vor dem Hintergrund theoretischer Überlegungen analysiert die vorliegende Studie indikatorgestützt Aspekte der Stabilität und Performance, die auch den Beitrag des deutschen Bankensektors zur gesamtwirtschaftlichen Entwicklung empirisch bestimmen lassen. Zum anderen werden Szenarien vorgestellt, die eine Einschätzung des vorhandenen Risikos im Bankensektor ermöglichen sollen. Abschließend wird ein kurzer Drei-Punkte-Plan zur Wiederherstellung der Stabilität des Bankensektors vorgestellt. In Germany banks play a major role in finance. In tranquil times the German banking sector was known as stable but low performing in terms of return on equity. Nevertheless, since years huge problems of the state-owned \"Landesbanken\" have been known. Meanwhile it became clear that single banks have the potential to destabilize the whole sector. Banking crises and the following re-stabilization of banks by state intervention are extremely expensive.

  {"id":"schultzDemocraticAdvantageInstitutional2003","abstract":"Despite their presumed liabilities, institutions associated with democracy serve as a source of power in prolonged international competition by increasing the financial resources that states can bring to bear. The theory of sovereign debt suggests that a state's ability to raise money through public borrowing is enhanced when debtholders have mechanisms for sanctioning state leaders in the event of default. Institutions associated with liberal government provide such mechanisms. All other things being equal, states that possess these institutions enjoy superior access to credit and lower interest rates than do states in which the sovereign has more discretion to default unilaterally. Liberal states can not only raise more money from a given economic base but can also pursue tax-smoothing policies that minimize economic distortions. The ability to finance competition in a manner that is consistent with long-term economic growth generates a significant advantage in prolonged rivalries. These claims are explored by analyzing the Anglo-French rivalry (1688–1815) and the Cold War.","author":[{"family":"Schultz","given":"Kenneth A."},{"family":"Weingast","given":"Barry R."}],"citation-key":"schultzDemocraticAdvantageInstitutional2003","container-title":"International Organization","DOI":"10.1017/S0020818303571065","issue":"01","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"page":"3-42","source":"Cambridge Journals Online","title":"The Democratic Advantage: Institutional Foundations of Financial Power in International Competition","title-short":"The Democratic Advantage","type":"article-journal","volume":"57"},

This division of Sociology into different subfields is to a large extent related to methodology and choices between qualitative or quantitative research methods. Relying on theoretical constructs of the academic prestige economy, boundary demarcation and taste for research, we examine the methodological divide in generalist Sociology journals. Using automated text analysis for 8737 abstracts of articles published between 1995 and 2017, we discover evidence of this divide, but also of an entanglement between methodological choices and different research topics. Moreover, our results suggest a marginally increasing time trend for the publication of quantitative research in generalist journals. We discuss how this consolidation of methodological practices could enforce the entrenchment of different schools of thought, which ultimately reduces the potential for innovative and effective sociological research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Schwemmer","given":"Carsten"},{"family":"Wieczorek","given":"Oliver"}],"citation-key":"schwemmerMethodologicalDivideSociology2020","container-title":"Sociology","container-title-short":"Sociology","DOI":"10.1177/0038038519853146","ISSN":"0038-0385","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"3-21","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Methodological Divide of Sociology: Evidence from Two Decades of Journal Publications","title-short":"The Methodological Divide of Sociology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0038038519853146","volume":"54"},

Findings show that more than half of all talks were given by white male speakers. While the share of women increased over time, it is constantly low for non-white speakers. Topic modelling further shows that the share of talks addressing inequalities which affect both groups is low, but increasing over time. However, talks about inequalities and those given by female speakers receive substantially more negative sentiment on YouTube than others.

Our goal was to assign items in our dataset to one of 21 policy topics based on the codebook of the Comparative Agendas Project. The classification of the imbalanced classes of topics was handled by a hybrid binary snowball workflow. This relies on limited human resources as well as supervised learning; it simplifies the multiclass problem to one of binary choice; and it is based on a snowball approach as we augment the training set with machine-classified observations after each successful round and also between corpora. Our results show that our approach provided better precision results (of over 80% for most topic codes) than what is customary for human coders and most computer-assisted coding projects.

For example, a naive metric for the comparison of concepts ordered in a partially ordered set and represented as nodes of a directed acyclic graph (e.g., a taxonomy), would be the shortest-path linking the two concept nodes.

  {"id":"serinaldiUseMisuseHurst2010","abstract":"The detection of long range dependence (LRD) is an important task in time series analysis. LRD is often summarized by the well-known Hurst parameter (or exponent) H ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] , which can be estimated by a number of methods. Some of these techniques are designed to be applied to signals behaving as a stationary fractional Gaussian noise (fGn), whereas others imply that the analyzed time series behave as a non-stationary fractional Brownian motion (fBm). Moreover, some estimators do not yield the Hurst parameter but indexes related to H and ranging outside the unit interval. Therefore, the fGn or fBm nature of the studied time series has to be preliminarily analyzed before applying any estimation method, and the relationships between H and the indexes resulting from the analyses have to be taken into account to obtain coherent results. Since fGn-like series represent the increments of fBm-like processes and both the signals are characterized by the same H value by definition, estimators designed for fGn-like series can be applied to fBm-like sequences after preventive differentiation, and conversely estimators designed for fBm-like processes can be applied to fGn-like series after preventive integration. The signal characterization is particularly important when H is estimated on financial time series because the returns represent the first difference of price time series, which are often assumed to behave like self-affine sequences. The analysis of simulated fGn and fBm time series shows that all the considered methods yield comparable H values when properly applied. The reanalysis of several market price time series already studied in the literature points out that a correct application of the estimators (supported by a preventive signal classification) yields homogeneous H values allowing for a useful cross-validation of results reported in different works. Moreover, some conclusions reported in the literature about the anti-persistence of some financial series are shown to be incorrect because of the inappropriate application of the estimation methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Serinaldi","given":"Francesco"}],"citation-key":"serinaldiUseMisuseHurst2010","container-title":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","container-title-short":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","DOI":"10.1016/j.physa.2010.02.044","ISSN":"0378-4371","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,7,15]]},"page":"2770-2781","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Use and misuse of some Hurst parameter estimators applied to stationary and non-stationary financial time series","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437110001718","volume":"389"},

  {"id":"shamirAgeResponsibilizationMarketembedded2008","abstract":"Abstract This article explores emerging discursive formations concerning the relationship of business and morality. It suggests that contemporary tendencies to economize public domains and methods of government also dialectically produce tendencies to moralize markets in general and business enterprises in particular. The article invokes the concept of ?responsibilization? as means of accounting for the epistemological and practical consequences of such processes. Looking at the underlying ?market rationality? of governance, and critically examining the notion of ?corporate social responsibility?, it concludes that the moralization of markets further sustains, rather than undermining, neo-liberal governmentalities and neo-liberal visions of civil society, citizenship and responsible social action.","author":[{"family":"Shamir","given":"Ronen"}],"citation-key":"shamirAgeResponsibilizationMarketembedded2008","container-title":"Economy and Society","DOI":"10.1080/03085140701760833","ISSN":"0308-5147","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"page":"1-19","source":"Taylor&Francis","title":"The age of responsibilization: on market-embedded morality","title-short":"The age of responsibilization","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03085140701760833","volume":"37"},

In this article, we focus on empirical work that considers how different dimensions of individuals' residential contexts become salient in their lives, how contexts influence individuals' lives over different timeframes, how individuals are affected by social processes operating at different scales, and how residential contexts influence the lives of individuals in heterogeneous ways. In other words, we review research that examines where, when, why, and for whom do residential contexts matter. Using the large literature on neighborhoods and educational and cognitive outcomes as an example, the research we review suggests that any attempt to reduce the literature to a single answer about whether neighborhoods matter is misguided. We call for a more flexible study of context effects in which theory, measurement, and methods are more closely aligned with the specific mechanisms and social processes under study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Sharkey","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Faber","given":"Jacob W."}],"citation-key":"sharkeyWhereWhenWhy2014","container-title":"Annual Review of Sociology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043350","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043350","page":"559-579","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Where, When, Why, and For Whom Do Residential Contexts Matter?

While general citation patterns have been widely studied in the literature we develop the notion of citation projection graphs by investigating the citations among the publications that a given paper cites.

We find that idiosyncratic citation patterns are characteristic for low impact papers; while narrow, discipline-focused citation patterns are common for medium impact papers. Our results show that crossing-community, or bridging citation patters are high risk and high reward since such patterns are characteristic for both low and high impact papers.

It does not appear possible to explain the boom in terms of fundamentals such as rents or construction costs. A psychological theory, that represents the boom as taking place because of a feedback mechanism or social epidemic that encourages a view of housing as an important investment opportunity, fits the evidence better. Three case studies of past booms are considered for comparison: the US housing boom of 1950, the US farmland boom of the 1970s, and the temporary interruption 2004-5 of the UK housing boom. The paper concludes that while it is possible that prices will continue to go up as is commonly expected, there is a high probability of steady and substantial real home price declines extending over years to come.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Shiller","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"shillerUnderstandingRecentTrends2007","container-title":"Proceedings - Economic Policy Symposium - Jackson Hole","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"page":"89-123","source":"ideas.repec.org","title":"Understanding recent trends in house prices and homeownership","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedkpr/y2007p89-123.html"},

  {"id":"shimokawaAgentbasedApproachFinancial2007","abstract":"An important challenge of the financial theory in recent years is to construct more sophisticated models which have consistencies with as many financial stylized facts that cannot be explained by traditional models. Recently, psychological studies on decision making under uncertainty which originate in Kahneman and Tversky's research attract a lot of interest as key factors which figure out the financial stylized facts. These psychological results have been applied to the theory of investor's decision making and financial equilibrium modeling. This paper, following these behavioral financial studies, would like to propose an agent-based equilibrium model with prospect theoretical features of investors. Our goal is to point out a possibility that loss-averse feature of investors explains vast number of financial stylized facts and plays a crucial role in price formations of financial markets. Price process which is endogenously generated through our model has consistencies with, not only the equity premium puzzle and the volatility puzzle, but great kurtosis, asymmetry of return distribution, auto-correlation of return volatility, cross-correlation between return volatility and trading volume. Moreover, by using agent-based simulations, the paper also provides a rigorous explanation from the viewpoint of a lack of market liquidity to the size effect, which means that small-sized stocks enjoy excess returns compared to large-sized stocks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Shimokawa","given":"Tetsuya"},{"family":"Suzuki","given":"Kyoko"},{"family":"Misawa","given":"Tadanobu"}],"citation-key":"shimokawaAgentbasedApproachFinancial2007","container-title":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","container-title-short":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","DOI":"10.1016/j.physa.2006.12.014","ISSN":"0378-4371","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,6,1]]},"page":"207-225","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"An agent-based approach to financial stylized facts","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437106013653","volume":"379"},

Building on Latour's actor network theory, we model published science as a dynamic hypergraph and explore how this fabric provides a substrate for future scientific discovery. Using millions of abstracts from MEDLINE, we show that the network distance between biomedical things (i.e., people, methods, diseases, chemicals) is surprisingly small. We then show how science moves from questions answered in one year to problems investigated in the next through a weighted random walk model. Our analysis reveals intriguing modal dispositions in the way biomedical science evolves: methods play a bridging role and things of one type connect through things of another. This has the methodological implication that adding more node types to network models of science and other creative domains will likely lead to a superlinear increase in prediction and understanding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Shi","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Foster","given":"Jacob G."},{"family":"Evans","given":"James A."}],"citation-key":"shiWeavingFabricScience2015","container-title":"Social Networks","container-title-short":"Social Networks","DOI":"10.1016/j.socnet.2015.02.006","ISSN":"0378-8733","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,10]]},"page":"73-85","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Weaving the fabric of science: Dynamic network models of science's unfolding structure","title-short":"Weaving the fabric of science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873315000118","volume":"43"},
  {"id":"shmargadSocialNormsDynamics2021","abstract":"Online discussions are performed in the gaze of fellow users. To increase engagement, platforms typically let these users evaluate the comments made by others through rating systems (e.g., via Likes or Down/Up votes). Understanding how such ratings shape, and are shaped by, features of the underlying discussion is important for our understanding of online behavior. In this study, we focus on an increasingly concerning aspect of online discussions: incivility. We draw on the theory of normative social behavior to analyze a data set of over 6,000 online newspaper comments. We find that repeated incivility by the same person is more likely when their initial incivility was affirmed by both descriptive norms (incivility in nearby comments) and injunctive norms (Up votes). Repeated incivility receives more Up votes if nearby comments also include incivility but fewer Up votes if they do not, suggesting that injunctive norms are contextual and shaped by descriptive norms. We conclude that online incivility is a dynamic, normative process that is responsive to both positive feedback and proximate incivility.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Shmargad","given":"Yotam"},{"family":"Coe","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Kenski","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Rains","given":"Stephen A."}],"citation-key":"shmargadSocialNormsDynamics2021","container-title":"Social Science Computer Review","container-title-short":"Social Science Computer Review","DOI":"10.1177/0894439320985527","ISSN":"0894-4393","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,7]]},"language":"en","page":"0894439320985527","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Social Norms and the Dynamics of Online Incivility","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439320985527"},

The theoretical part of this article discusses various aspects of agenda setting and their theoretical relevance in the context of the Bundestag. It will be argued that analyses of agenda setting should distinguish between two analytical foci, one concentrating on policy effects in the context of spatial models, the other analysing executive–legislative relations in the broader context of political competition. In addition, agenda setting among veto players should be distinguished from agenda setting between veto players and non-veto players. While the article's theoretical part drives the subsequent empirical analysis, readers more interested in the empirical aspects of agenda setting in the Bundestag may wish to turn directly to the article's second section, which provides an empirical and descriptive account of the formal rules of agenda setting in the Bundestag. In this part, it will be argued that the weakness of the government under the Bundestag's first permanent rules of procedure introduced in the early 1950s can be explained by historic circumstances. Since then, party system characteristics and the strong role of the Bundesrat have made it unattractive for the federal government to seek increased agenda control in the Bundestag.

Here I draw on observations around how the demands of paddy rice cultivation shape social interaction to demonstrate that the relative importance of reciprocity, transitivity and generalised exchange to who rice producers choose as friends varies with the amount of agricultural land under their control. In doing so, I use unique data on farm size and friendship amongst 4713 rice-growing smallholders in 162 rural villages in Jiangxi, China along with a new technique for measuring the relative importance of effects in Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models. In line with the micro-level component of the recently advanced “theory of network ecology”, results suggest that features of an individual’s proximal environment can powerfully moderate the relative expression of network-formation mechanisms such that for some individuals, a dynamic may be expected to hold substantial sway over the process of choosing social contacts and, for others, no sway at all.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Simpson","given":"Cohen R."}],"citation-key":"simpsonFarmSizeShapes2020","container-title":"Social Networks","container-title-short":"Social Networks","DOI":"10.1016/j.socnet.2019.10.001","ISSN":"0378-8733","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"107-127","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Farm size shapes friend choice amongst rice producers in China: Some evidence for the theory of network ecology","title-short":"Farm size shapes friend choice amongst rice producers in China","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873319301078","volume":"61"},

Rather than being the product of disembedded market forces, this new global political economy is organized by specialized forms of intelligence gathering and judgment determination inside the new global finance (NGF).

The author analyzes central features of EKNs, including their relationship to social interests, epistemic authority (the consequences that follow from EKN reputational assets), market coordination (the policy implications of EKN transformation of uncertainty into risk), and the complexities that characterize the interaction between EKNs and governments. The author argues that rather than disappearing with the increasing freedom of global market forces in the NGF, authority has been reinvented—characteristically in the form of EKNs—altering the postwar balance of public and private influence on policy formation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Sinclair","given":"Timothy J."}],"citation-key":"sinclairReinventingAuthorityEmbedded2000","container-title":"Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy","DOI":"10.1068/c10c","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"page":"487 – 502","source":"Pion Journals","title":"Reinventing authority: embedded knowledge networks and the new global finance","title-short":"Reinventing authority","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=c10c","volume":"18"},

Infants crawl and then walk, children learn to read and write, teenagers mature in myriad ways, the elderly become frail and forgetful. Beyond these natural processes and events, external forces and interventions instigate and disrupt change: test scores may rise after a coaching course, drug abusers may remain abstinent after residential treatment. By charting changes over time and investigating whether and when events occur, researchers reveal the temporal rhythms of our lives. Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis is a much-needed professional book for empirical researchers and graduate students in the behavioral, social, and biomedical sciences. It offers the first accessible in-depth presentation of two of today's most popular statistical methods: multilevel models for individual change and hazard/survival models for event occurrence (in both discrete- and continuous-time). Using clear, concise prose and real data sets from published studies, the authors take you step by step through complete analyses, from simple exploratory displays that reveal underlying patterns through sophisticated specifications of complex statistical models.  Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis offers readers a private consultation session with internationally recognized experts and represents a unique contribution to the literature on quantitative empirical methods.

We focus on the relation between increasing complexity of the economic network and its stability with respect to small perturbations in the dynamical variables associated with the constituent nodes. Inherent delays and multiple time-scales suggest that economic systems will be more likely to exhibit instabilities as their complexity is increased even though the speed at which transactions are conducted has increased many-fold through technological developments. Analogous to the birth of nonlinear dynamics from Poincare's work on the question of whether the solar system is stable, we suggest that similar theoretical developments may arise from efforts by econophysicists to understand the mechanisms by which instabilities arise in the economy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Sinha","given":"Sitabhra"}],"citation-key":"sinhaAreLargeComplex2010","container-title":"arXiv:1009.0972","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,9,6]]},"note":"Science and Culture, 76 (2010) 454-458","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Are large complex economic systems unstable ?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0972"},

  {"id":"sinhaComplexityVsStability2004","abstract":"According to the May-Wigner stability theorem, increasing the complexity of a network inevitably leads to its destabilization, such that a small perturbation will be able to disrupt the entire system. One of the principal arguments against this observation is that it is valid only for random networks, and therefore does not apply to real-world networks, which presumably are structured. Here we examine how the introduction of small-world topological structure into networks affect their stability. Our results indicate that, in structured networks, the parameter values at which the stability-instability transition occurs with increasing complexity is identical to that predicted by the May-Wigner criteria. However, the nature of the transition, as measured by the finite-size scaling exponent, appears to change as the network topology transforms from regular to random, with the small-world regime as the cross-over region. This behavior is related to the localization of the largest eigenvalues along the real axis in the eigenvalue plain with increasing regularity in the network.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Sinha","given":"Sitabhra"}],"citation-key":"sinhaComplexityVsStability2004","container-title":"arXiv:nlin/0407053","DOI":"10.1016/j.physa.2004.08.062","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,7,24]]},"note":"Physica A 346 (2005) 147-153","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Complexity vs stability in small-world networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0407053"},

Systematic reviews suggest that complex, whole-school anti-bullying interventions are effective at reducing victimization and bullying in high-income countries (HICs). We report a systematic review evaluating the effectiveness of school-based interventions to reduce and prevent bullying among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In addition to searching 31 databases, we also hand searched key journals and grey literature. We contacted experts in the field for input during the search process. After rigorously screening retrieved studies against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria, only three studies were included in this review. One study used a cognitive and behavioral approach to target bullying among adolescents in Romania, one study adapted the international Olweus Bullying Prevention Program (OBPP) for use in Malaysia, and the other developed a model for use in South Africa. Results from all three studies were mixed and provided no overall evidence of effect for the interventions. The validity of the results for two of the studies was unclear due to substantial or unclear risks of bias. Given the well-established evidence base for anti-bullying interventions in HICs, there is an urgent need for more rigorously evaluated and reported studies in LMICs, adapted for contexts of considerable resource constraints.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Sivaraman","given":"Bhagya"},{"family":"Nye","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Bowes","given":"Lucy"}],"citation-key":"sivaramanSchoolbasedAntibullyingInterventions2019","collection-title":"Bullying and cyberbullying: Protective factors and effective interventions","container-title":"Aggression and Violent Behavior","container-title-short":"Aggression and Violent Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.avb.2018.07.007","ISSN":"1359-1789","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"154-162","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"School-based anti-bullying interventions for adolescents in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review","title-short":"School-based anti-bullying interventions for adolescents in low- and middle-income countries","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178918301150","volume":"45"},

  {"id":"smaldinoNaturalSelectionBad","abstract":"Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing—no deliberate cheating nor loafing—by scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more ‘progeny,’ such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Smaldino","given":"Paul E."},{"family":"McElreath","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"smaldinoNaturalSelectionBad","container-title":"Royal Society Open Science","container-title-short":"Royal Society Open Science","DOI":"10.1098/rsos.160384","issue":"9","page":"160384","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"The natural selection of bad science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.160384","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"smallHowStableCore2015","abstract":"Researchers have paid increasing attention to the core discussion network, the set of people we turn to when discussing important matters. Because the core discussion network is theorized to be composed of people's closest ties, not fleeting acquaintances, it is expected to be largely stable, evolving slowly over the span of people's lives. However, recent studies have shown that networks are strongly affected by the contexts in which people interact with others, and as people experience life course transitions, they also often enter new contexts – school, college, work, marriage, and retirement. We ask whether, as actors enter new social contexts, the core discussion network remains stable or changes rapidly. Based on original, longitudinal, qualitative and quantitative data on the experience of first-year graduate students in three academic departments in a large university, we examine the stability of the core discussion network over the first 6 and 12 months in this new context. We test four competing hypotheses that focus on strength of ties, new opportunities, obligations, and routine activity and predict, respectively, stasis, expansion, shedding, and substitution. We find that the core discussion network changes remarkably quickly, with little or no lag, and that it appears to do so because both the obligations that people face and the routine activities they engage in are transformed by new institutional environments. Findings suggest that core discussion network may be less a “core” network than a highly contextual support network in which people are added and dropped as actors shift from environment to environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Small","given":"Mario Luis"},{"family":"Deeds Pamphile","given":"Vontrese"},{"family":"McMahan","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"smallHowStableCore2015","container-title":"Social Networks","container-title-short":"Social Networks","DOI":"10.1016/j.socnet.2014.09.001","ISSN":"0378-8733","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"90-102","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"How stable is the core discussion network?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873314000513","volume":"40"},

Focusing primarily on work at the meso- and microlevels of analysis, we pay special attention to studies examining spatial processes in neighborhood and organizational contexts. We argue that spatial context plays a role in the formation of social ties through at least three mechanisms, spatial propinquity, spatial composition, and spatial configuration; that fully capturing the role of spatial context will require multiple disciplinary perspectives and both qualitative and quantitative research; and that both methodological and conceptual questions central to the role of space in networks remain to be answered.

  {"id":"smallSomeoneTalk2017","abstract":"When people are facing difficulties, they often feel the need for a confidant-a person to vent to or a sympathetic ear with whom to talk things through. How do they decide on whom to rely? In theory, the answer seems obvious: if the matter is personal, they will turn to a spouse, a family member, or someone close. In practice, what people actually do often belies these expectations. In Someone To Talk To, Mario Luis Small follows a group of graduate students as they cope with stress, overwork, self-doubt, failure, relationships, children, health care, and poverty. He unravels how they decide whom to turn to for support. And he then confirms his findings based on representative national data on adult Americans. Small shows that rather than consistently relying on their \"strong ties,\" Americans often take pains to avoid close friends and family, as these relationships are both complex and fraught with expectations. In contrast, they often confide in \"weak ties,\" as the need for understanding or empathy trumps their fear of misplaced trust. In fact, people may find themselves confiding in acquaintances and even strangers unexpectedly, without having reflected on the consequences. Someone To Talk To reveals the often counter-intuitive nature of social support, helping us understand when people will keep depression secret from their close ones, why people may avoid reporting sexual assault, how people may decide whom to come out to, and why even competitors can be among a person's best confidants. Amid a growing wave of big data and large-scale network analysis, Small returns to the basic questions of whom we connect with, how, and why, upending decades of conventional wisdom on how we should think about and analyze social networks.","author":[{"family":"Small","given":"Mario Luis"}],"citation-key":"smallSomeoneTalk2017","ISBN":"978-0-19-066144-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,27]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"269","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Someone To Talk To","type":"book"},

Therefore, same-ethnic friendship preferences, or ethnic homophily, can work at cross-purposes with policy recommendations to diversify ethnic representation in social settings. In order to effectively overcome ethnic segregation, we need to identify those factors within diverse settings that exacerbate the tendency toward ethnic homophily. Using unique data and multiple network analyses, the authors examine 529 adolescent friendship networks in English, German, Dutch, and Swedish schools and find that the ethnic composition of school classes relates differently to immigrant and native homophily. Immigrant homophily disproportionately increases as immigrants see more same-ethnic peers, and friendship density among natives has no effect on this. By contrast, native homophily remains relatively low until natives see dense groups of immigrants. The authors’ results suggest that theories of interethnic competition and contact opportunities apply differently to ethnic majority and minority groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Sanne"},{"family":"McFarland","given":"Daniel A."},{"family":"Van Tubergen","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Maas","given":"Ineke"}],"citation-key":"smithEthnicCompositionFriendship2016","container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","container-title-short":"American Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1086/684032","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,1]]},"page":"1223-1272","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Ethnic Composition and Friendship Segregation: Differential Effects for Adolescent Natives and Immigrants","title-short":"Ethnic Composition and Friendship Segregation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/684032","volume":"121"},
  {"id":"snijdersIntroductionStochasticActorbased2010","abstract":"Stochastic actor-based models are models for network dynamics that can represent a wide variety of influences on network change, and allow to estimate parameters expressing such influences, and test corresponding hypotheses. The nodes in the network represent social actors, and the collection of ties represents a social relation. The assumptions posit that the network evolves as a stochastic process ‘driven by the actors’, i.e., the model lends itself especially for representing theories about how actors change their outgoing ties. The probabilities of tie changes are in part endogenously determined, i.e., as a function of the current network structure itself, and in part exogenously, as a function of characteristics of the nodes (‘actor covariates’) and of characteristics of pairs of nodes (‘dyadic covariates’). In an extended form, stochastic actor-based models can be used to analyze longitudinal data on social networks jointly with changing attributes of the actors: dynamics of networks and behavior.\n\nThis paper gives an introduction to stochastic actor-based models for dynamics of directed networks, using only a minimum of mathematics. The focus is on understanding the basic principles of the model, understanding the results, and on sensible rules for model selection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Snijders","given":"Tom A.

We discover that the correlation among market indices presents both a fast and a slow dynamics. The slow dynamics reflects the development and consolidation of globalization. The fast dynamics is associated with critical events that originate in a specific country or region of the world and rapidly affect the global system. We provide evidence that the short term time scale of correlation among market indices is less than 3 trading months (about 60 trading days). The average values of the nondiagonal elements of the correlation matrix, correlation-based graphs, and the spectral properties of the largest eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the correlation matrix are carrying information about the fast and slow dynamics of the correlation of market indices.

  {"id":"sornetteWhyStockMarkets2009","abstract":"The scientific study of complex systems has transformed a wide range of disciplines in recent years, enabling researchers in both the natural and social sciences to model and predict phenomena as diverse as earthquakes, global warming, demographic patterns, financial crises, and the failure of materials. In this book, Didier Sornette boldly applies his varied experience in these areas to propose a simple, powerful, and general theory of how, why, and when stock markets crash. Most attempts to explain market failures seek to pinpoint triggering mechanisms that occur hours, days, or weeks before the collapse. Sornette proposes a radically different view: the underlying cause can be sought months and even years before the abrupt, catastrophic event in the build-up of cooperative speculation, which often translates into an accelerating rise of the market price, otherwise known as a \"bubble.\" Anchoring his sophisticated, step-by-step analysis in leading-edge physical and statistical modeling techniques, he unearths remarkable insights and some predictions--among them, that the \"end of the growth era\" will occur around 2050. Sornette probes major historical precedents, from the decades-long \"tulip mania\" in the Netherlands that wilted suddenly in 1637 to the South Sea Bubble that ended with the first huge market crash in England in 1720, to the Great Crash of October 1929 and Black Monday in 1987, to cite just a few. He concludes that most explanations other than cooperative self-organization fail to account for the subtle bubbles by which the markets lay the groundwork for catastrophe. Any investor or investment professional who seeks a genuine understanding of looming financial disasters should read this book. Physicists, geologists, biologists, economists, and others will welcome Why Stock Markets Crash as a highly original \"scientific tale,\" as Sornette aptly puts it, of the exciting and sometimes fearsome--but no longer quite so unfathomable--world of stock markets.

  {"id":"steaneQuantumComputing1998","abstract":"The subject of quantum computing brings together ideas from classical information theory, computer science, and quantum physics. This review aims to summarize not just quantum computing, but the whole subject of quantum information theory. Information can be identified as the most general thing which must propagate from a cause to an effect. It therefore has a fundamentally important role in the science of physics. However, the mathematical treatment of information, especially information processing, is quite recent, dating from the mid-20th century. This has meant that the full significance of information as a basic concept in physics is only now being discovered. This is especially true in quantum mechanics. The theory of quantum information and computing puts this significance on a firm footing, and has led to some profound and exciting new insights into the natural world. Among these are the use of quantum states to permit the secure transmission of classical information (quantum cryptography), the use of quantum entanglement to permit reliable transmission of quantum states (teleportation), the possibility of preserving quantum coherence in the presence of irreversible noise processes (quantum error correction), and the use of controlled quantum evolution for efficient computation (quantum computation). The common theme of all these insights is the use of quantum entanglement as a computational resource.  It turns out that information theory and quantum mechanics fit together very well. In order to explain their relationship, this review begins with an introduction to classical information theory and computer science, including Shannon's theorem, error correcting codes, Turing machines and computational complexity. The principles of quantum mechanics are then outlined, and the Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) experiment described. The EPR-Bell correlations, and quantum entanglement in general, form the essential new ingredient which distinguishes quantum from classical information theory and, arguably, quantum from classical physics.  Basic quantum information ideas are next outlined, including qubits and data compression, quantum gates, the `no cloning' property and teleportation. Quantum cryptography is briefly sketched. The universal quantum computer (QC) is described, based on the Church-Turing principle and a network model of computation. Algorithms for such a computer are discussed, especially those for finding the period of a function, and searching a random list. Such algorithms prove that a QC of sufficiently precise construction is not only fundamentally different from any computer which can only manipulate classical information, but can compute a small class of functions with greater efficiency. This implies that some important computational tasks are impossible for any device apart from a QC.  To build a universal QC is well beyond the abilities of current technology. However, the principles of quantum information physics can be tested on smaller devices. The current experimental situation is reviewed, with emphasis on the linear ion trap, high-Q optical cavities, and nuclear magnetic resonance methods. These allow coherent control in a Hilbert space of eight dimensions (three qubits) and should be extendable up to a thousand or more dimensions (10 qubits). Among other things, these systems will allow the feasibility of quantum computing to be assessed. In fact such experiments are so difficult that it seemed likely until recently that a practically useful QC (requiring, say, 1000 qubits) was actually ruled out by considerations of experimental imprecision and the unavoidable coupling between any system and its environment. However, a further fundamental part of quantum information physics provides a solution to this impasse. This is quantum error correction (QEC).  An introduction to QEC is provided. The evolution of the QC is restricted to a carefully chosen subspace of its Hilbert space. Errors are almost certain to cause a departure from this subspace. QEC provides a means to detect and undo such departures without upsetting the quantum computation. This achieves the apparently impossible, since the computation preserves quantum coherence even though during its course all the qubits in the computer will have relaxed spontaneously many times.  The review concludes with an outline of the main features of quantum information physics and avenues for future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Steane","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"steaneQuantumComputing1998","container-title":"Reports on Progress in Physics","container-title-short":"Rep.

Different behavioral profiles (imitation, anti-imitation, indifference) were proposed for the investors, which take their decision based on their trust network (neighborhood). Results from agent-based models have shown that most of the features observed in actual stock market indices can be replicated in simulations. Here, we present a deeper investigation of an agent based model considering different network morphologies (regular, random, small-world) for the investors’ trust network, in an attempt to answer the question raised in the title. We study the model by considering four scenarios for the investors and different initial conditions to analyze their influence in the stock market fluctuations. We have characterized the stationary limit for each scenario tested, focusing on the changes introduced when complex networks were used, and calculated the Hurst exponent in some cases. Simulations showed interesting results suggesting that the fluctuations of the stock market index are strongly affected by the network morphology, a remarkable result which we believe was never reported or predicted before.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Stefan","given":"F.

We show how higher education has been central to projects of nation building and social provision throughout the course of American political development. US higher education has three institutional configurations: an associational one, defined by voluntary intermural organizations; a national service one, defined by massive government patronage; and a market one, defined by competition for students, patrons, and prestige. Continuity and change over time may be understood with the theoretical tools of historical sociology: path dependence, coalescence, and robust action. Our review substantiates assertions of deep turbulence in US higher education at present and calls for a closer integration of scholarship on state building and social stratification to inform the future.

  {"id":"stewartThreePapersPolitical2015","abstract":"This collection of three papers develops two statistical techniques for addressing canonical problems in applied computational social science: unsupervised text analysis and regression with dependent data.  In both cases I provide a flexible framework that allows the analyst to leverage known structure within the data to improve inference.  The first paper introduces the Structural Topic Model (STM) which generalizes and extends a broad class of probabilistic topic models developed in computer science.  Crucially for applied social science, STM provides a framework for estimating the factors which drive topical frequency and content within documents.  The second paper explores the challenge that non-convex likelihoods pose for applied research with topic models.  The paper presents a series of diagnostics and discusses the under-appreciated role of initialization methods.  The third paper introduces Latent Factor Regressions (LFR), a new set of tools for regression modeling in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity or dependence between observations.  The approach uses interactive latent effects to provide a unified framework for modeling different data structures, including network, time-series cross-sectional and spatial data.  \n\nEach of these methods is designed with a focus on applied work. Estimation algorithms are presented which are fast enough for applied work and software is either currently available (STM) or in development (LFR).  The use of these techniques is illustrated with a range of applications from across political science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Stewart","given":"Brandon Michael"}],"citation-key":"stewartThreePapersPolitical2015","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,18]]},"language":"en","note":"Accepted: 2015-07-17T16:52:37Z","source":"dash.harvard.edu","title":"Three Papers in Political Methodology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/17467206"},

  {"id":"stiglitzGlobalizationItsDiscontents2002","abstract":"This powerful, unsettling book gives us a rare glimpse behind the closed doors of global financial institutions by the winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics.When it was first published, this national bestseller quickly became a touchstone in the globalization debate. Renowned economist and Nobel Prize winner Joseph E. Stiglitz had a ringside seat for most of the major economic events of the last decade, including stints as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and chief economist at the World Bank. Particularly concerned with the plight of the developing nations, he became increasingly disillusioned as he saw the International Monetary Fund and other major institutions put the interests of Wall Street and the financial community ahead of the poorer nations. Those seeking to understand why globalization has engendered the hostility of protesters in Seattle and Genoa will find the reasons here. While this book includes no simple formula on how to make globalization work, Stiglitz provides a reform agenda that will provoke debate for years to come. Rarely do we get such an insider's analysis of the major institutions of globalization as in this penetrating book. With a new foreword for this paperback edition.

  {"id":"stockhammerFinancializationIncomeDistribution2012","abstract":"The paper argues that the process of financialization has profoundly changed how capitalist economies operate. The financial sector has grown relative to the real economy and become more fragile. Non-financial businesses have adopted shareholder value orientation, which had negative effects on investment. Working class households became squeezed because of rising inequality and have become more indebted, in particular in countries with real estate bubbles. Financial globalization has given rise to growing international imbalances, which have allowed two growth models to emerge: a debt-led consumption growth model and an export-led growth model. Both should be understood as reactions to the lack of effective demand due to the polarization of income distribution. The resulting finance-dominated accumulation regime is characterized by slow and fragile growth. The crisis is best understood as the outcome of the interaction of financialization and changes in income distribution. El artículo argumenta que el proceso de financiarización ha modificado profundamente la manera en que operan las economías capitalistas. El sector financiero ha crecido relativamente al sector real de la economía y ha devenido más frágil.

Los hogares de la dase trabajadora fueron afectados al incrementarse la desigualdad y se han endeudado mas, en particular en los paises con burbujas en el sector de bienes rakes. La globalizacion financiera ha dado lugar a crecientes desequilibrios internacionales, lo cual ha propiciado el surgimiento de dos modelos de crecimiento: un modelo de crecimiento de consumo dirigido por la deuda y un modelo de crecimiento dirigido por las exportaciones. Ambos deben entenderse como reacciones a la insuficiencia de demanda efectiva debido a la polarizacion de la distribución del ingreso.

With data from a national telephone survey of non-Latino adults (N = 1,364), we estimate the predictors of perceived criminal threat as well as the effects of perceived threat and other factors on immigration policy preferences. Results indicate that political ideology and education are the strongest predictors of perceived criminal threat. Perceived criminal threat has the greatest influence on support for more punitive controls and partially mediates the effects of race, education, political ideology, and contextual threat on these control preferences. Future social threat research should consider the inclusion of perceptual threat measures instead of relying solely on contextual indicators of threat. In addition, contextual threat should be explored more often in dynamic, rather than static, terms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Stupi","given":"Elizabeth K."},{"family":"Chiricos","given":"Ted"},{"family":"Gertz","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"stupiPerceivedCriminalThreat2016","container-title":"Justice Quarterly","DOI":"10.1080/07418825.2014.902093","ISSN":"0741-8825","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,23]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2014.902093","page":"239-266","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Perceived Criminal Threat from Undocumented Immigrants: Antecedents and Consequences for Policy Preferences","title-short":"Perceived Criminal Threat from Undocumented Immigrants","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2014.902093","volume":"33"},
  {"id":"subramanianMacroeconomicDeterminantsHealth2002","abstract":"Why are some societies healthier than others? The consensus in development economics is that the health achievement of nations has to do with their levels of economic development. Higher per capita incomes, through steady and stable economic growth, increase a nation's capacity to purchase the necessary economic goods and services that promote health. In this paper, we review the conceptual and empirical linkages between poverty and poor health in both developing and developed countries. The empirical evidence is overwhelming that poverty, measured at the level of societies as well as individuals, is causally related to poor health of societies and individuals, respectively. Recent macroeconomic research has also drawn attention to the role of health as a form of human capital that is vital for achieving economic stability. In particular, attention has been drawn toward the ways in which unhealthy societies impede the process of economic development. However, the reciprocal connection between economic prosperity and improved health is neither automatic nor universal.

  {"id":"sugarFindingNumberClusters2003","abstract":"One of the most difficult problems in cluster analysis is identifying the number of groups in a dataset. Most previously suggested approaches to this problem are either somewhat ad hoc or require parametric assumptions and complicated calculations. In this article we develop a simple, yet powerful nonparametric method for choosing the number of clusters based on distortion, a quantity that measures the average distance, per dimension, between each observation and its closest cluster center. Our technique is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement. We demonstrate empirically its effectiveness, not only for choosing the number of clusters, but also for identifying underlying structure, on a wide range of simulated and real world datasets. In addition, we give a rigorous theoretical justification for the method based on information-theoretic ideas. Specifically, results from the subfield of electrical engineering known as rate distortion theory allow us to describe the behavior of the distortion in both the presence and absence of clustering. Finally, we note that these ideas potentially can be extended to a wide range of other statistical model selection problems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Sugar","given":"Catherine A."},{"family":"James","given":"Gareth M."}],"citation-key":"sugarFindingNumberClusters2003","container-title":"Journal of the American Statistical Association","DOI":"10.1198/016214503000000666","ISSN":"0162-1459","issue":"463","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,9,1]]},"page":"750-763","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Finding the Number of Clusters in a Dataset","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1198/016214503000000666","volume":"98"},

  {"id":"sumnerAdherenceSuicideReporting2020","abstract":"<p>Rates of suicide in the United States are at a more than 20-y high. Suicide contagion, or spread of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors through exposure to sensationalized and harmful content is a well-recognized phenomenon. Health authorities have published guidelines for news media reporting on suicide to help prevent contagion; however, uptake of recommendations remains limited. A key barrier to widespread voluntary uptake of suicide-reporting guidelines is that more sensational content is perceived to be more engaging to readers and thus enhances publisher visibility and engagement; however, no empirical information exists on the actual influence of adherence to safe-reporting practices on reader engagement. Hence, we conducted a study to analyze adherence to suicide-reporting guidelines on news shared on social media and to assess how adherence affects reader engagement. Our analysis of Facebook data revealed that harmful elements were prevalent in news articles about suicide shared on social media while the presence of protective elements was generally rare. Contrary to popular perception, closer adherence to safe-reporting practices was associated with a greater likelihood of an article being reshared (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10 to 1.27) and receiving positive engagement (“love” reactions) (AOR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.13 to 1.26). Mean safe-reporting scores were lower in the US than other English-speaking nations and variation existed by publisher characteristics. Our results provide empirical evidence that improved adherence to suicide-reporting guidelines may benefit not only the health of individuals, but also support publisher goals of reach and engagement.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Sumner","given":"Steven A."},{"family":"Burke","given":"Moira"},{"family":"Kooti","given":"Farshad"}],"citation-key":"sumnerAdherenceSuicideReporting2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2001230117","ISBN":"9782001230112","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,2]]},"language":"en","PMID":"32631982","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Social Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Adherence to suicide reporting guidelines by news shared on a social networking platform","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/07/01/2001230117"},

Many efforts have been made to detect manipulation in stock markets. However, it is still an open problem to identify the fraudulent traders, especially when they collude with each other. In this paper, we focus on the problem of identifying the anomalous traders using the transaction data of eight manipulated stocks and forty-four non-manipulated stocks during a one-year period. By analyzing the trading networks of stocks, we find that the trading networks of manipulated stocks exhibit significantly higher degree-strength correlation than the trading networks of non-manipulated stocks and the randomized trading networks. We further propose a method to detect anomalous traders of manipulated stocks based on statistical significance analysis of degree-strength correlation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective at distinguishing the manipulated stocks from non-manipulated ones. Our method outperforms the traditional weight-threshold method at identifying the anomalous traders in manipulated stocks.

No quantitative model to date allows us to validate competing theories on the different roles of endogenous processes, such as social collaborations, and exogenous events, such as scientific discoveries. Here we propose an agent-based model in which the evolution of disciplines is guided mainly by social interactions among agents representing scientists. Disciplines emerge from splitting and merging of social communities in a collaboration network. We find that this social model can account for a number of stylized facts about the relationships between disciplines, scholars, and publications. These results provide strong quantitative support for the key role of social interactions in shaping the dynamics of science. While several “science of science” theories exist, this is the first account for the emergence of disciplines that is validated on the basis of empirical data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Xiaoling"},{"family":"Kaur","given":"Jasleen"},{"family":"Milojević","given":"Staša"},{"family":"Flammini","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Menczer","given":"Filippo"}],"citation-key":"sunSocialDynamicsScience2013","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/srep01069","ISSN":"2045-2322","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1,15]]},"language":"en","page":"1069","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Social Dynamics of Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01069","volume":"3"},

We then classify the nodes of trading network into three roles according to their connectivity pattern. Strong Granger causality is found between stock price and trading relationship indices, i.e., the fraction of trading relationship among nodes with different roles. We further predict stock price by incorporating these trading relationship indices into a neural network based on time series of stock price.

The picture that emerges is that economists and sociologists have paid little attention to each other during most of the twentieth century: social problems have been analyzed as if they had no economic dimension and economic problems as if they had no social dimension. Today, however, there is a dialogue between the two fields, as economists take on social topics and as sociologists become interested in rational choice and \"new economic sociology.\" The interviewees describe how they came to challenge the present separation between economics and sociology, what they think of the various proposals to integrate the fields, and how they envision the future.

Second, to obtain more insight into the complexity and periodicity in traffic time series, we then construct complex networks from traffic time series by considering each day as a cycle and each cycle as a single node. The optimal threshold value of complex networks is estimated by the distribution of density and its derivative. In addition, the complex networks are subsequently analyzed in terms of some statistical properties, such as average path length, clustering coefficient, density, average degree and betweenness.

  {"id":"taoCompetitiveMarketMultiple2010","abstract":"The origin of economic crises is a key problem for economics. We present a model of long-run competitive markets to show that the multiplicity of behaviors in an economic system, over a long time scale, emerge as statistical regularities (perfectly competitive markets obey Bose-Einstein statistics and purely monopolistic-competitive markets obey Boltzmann statistics) and that how interaction among firms influences the evolutionary of competitive markets. It has been widely accepted that perfect competition is most efficient. Our study shows that the perfectly competitive system, as an extreme case of competitive markets, is most efficient but not stable, and gives rise to economic crises as society reaches full employment. In the economic crisis revealed by our model, many firms condense (collapse) into the lowest supply level (zero supply, namely, bankruptcy status), in analogy to Bose-Einstein condensation. This curious phenomenon arises because perfect competition (homogeneous competitions) equals symmetric (indistinguishable) investment direction, a fact abhorred by nature. Therefore, we urge the promotion of monopolistic competition (heterogeneous competitions) rather than perfect competition. To provide early warning of economic crises, we introduce a resolving index of investment, which approaches zero in the run-up to an economic crisis. On the other hand, our model discloses, as a profound conclusion, that the technological level for a long-run social or economic system is proportional to the freedom (disorder) of this system; in other words, technology equals the entropy of system.

For the practitioners, the association of creativity with art carries a promise of transcendence and escape from ordinary life but also a potential challenge to their own entitlement and claims to a creative status. These findings demonstrate that the academic areas utilize different and conflicting conceptualizations and, second, that the practitioner concept is not consistent with any one of these.

  {"id":"teplitskiySociologyScientificValidity2018","abstract":"Professional connections between the creators and evaluators of scientific work are ubiquitous, and the possibility of bias ever-present. Although connections have been shown to bias predictions of uncertain future performance, it is unknown whether such biases occur in the more concrete task of assessing scientific validity for completed works, and if so, how. This study presents evidence that connections between authors and reviewers of neuroscience manuscripts are associated with biased judgments and explores the mechanisms driving that effect. Using reviews from 7981 neuroscience manuscripts submitted to the journal PLOS ONE, which instructs reviewers to evaluate manuscripts on scientific validity alone, we find that reviewers favored authors close in the co-authorship network by ∼0.11 points on a 1.0–4.0 scale for each step of proximity. PLOS ONE’s validity-focused review and the substantial favoritism shown by distant vs. very distant reviewers, both of whom should have little to gain from nepotism, point to the central role of substantive disagreements between scientists in different professional networks (“schools of thought”). These results suggest that removing bias from peer review cannot be accomplished simply by recusing closely connected reviewers, and highlight the value of recruiting reviewers embedded in diverse professional networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Teplitskiy","given":"Misha"},{"family":"Acuna","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Elamrani-Raoult","given":"Aïda"},{"family":"Körding","given":"Konrad"},{"family":"Evans","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"teplitskiySociologyScientificValidity2018","container-title":"Research Policy","container-title-short":"Research Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.respol.2018.06.014","ISSN":"0048-7333","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1825-1841","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The sociology of scientific validity: How professional networks shape judgement in peer review","title-short":"The sociology of scientific validity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733318301598","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"terwalBestBothWorlds2016","abstract":"Open networks give actors non-redundant information that is diverse, while closed networks offer redundant information that is easier to interpret. Integrating arguments about network structure and the similarity of actors’ knowledge, we propose two types of network configurations that combine diversity and ease of interpretation. Closed-diverse networks offer diversity in actors’ knowledge domains and shared third-party ties to help in interpreting that knowledge. In open-specialized networks, structural holes offer diversity, while shared interpretive schema and overlap between received information and actors’ prior knowledge help in interpreting new information without the help of third parties. In contrast, actors in open-diverse networks suffer from information overload due to the lack of shared schema or overlapping prior knowledge for the interpretation of diverse information, and actors in closed-specialized networks suffer from overembeddedness because they cannot access diverse information. Using CrunchBase data on early-stage venture capital investments in the U.S. information technology sector, we test the effect of investors’ social capital on the success of their portfolio ventures. We find that ventures have the highest chances of success if their syndicating investors have either open-specialized or closed-diverse networks. These effects are manifested beyond the direct effects of ventures’ or investors’ quality and are robust to controlling for the possibility that certain investors could have chosen more promising ventures at the time of first funding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Ter Wal","given":"Anne L.J."},{"family":"Alexy","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Block","given":"Jörn"},{"family":"Sandner","given":"Philipp G."}],"citation-key":"terwalBestBothWorlds2016","container-title":"Administrative Science Quarterly","container-title-short":"Administrative Science Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/0001839216637849","ISSN":"0001-8392","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"393-432","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Best of Both Worlds: The Benefits of Open-specialized and Closed-diverse Syndication Networks for New Ventures’ Success","title-short":"The Best of Both Worlds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0001839216637849","volume":"61"},

However, the researchers dealing with recurrent events in survival analysis have ignored the assumption that the recurrent events are correlated. There are methods available that takes into account dependency between recurrent events. The main objective of this study was to demonstrate the recurrent event models using upper respiratory infection (URI) among Indian infants.\nMethods\nThe frequency of URI among a birth cohort of 210 babies was evaluated monthly with nasopharyngeal swabbing. Data on 11 potential risk factors were noted. The extended Cox models, such as Andersen-Gill counting process (CP), Prentice-Williams-Peterson (PWP-CP), PWP–Gap time model, Marginal Model and Cox frailty model were applied. The better model was assessed based on Loglikehood test statistics.\nResults\nOf the four models, PWP-CP model had lower log likelihood value. The URI incidence rate was estimated to be 2.27 (95%CI: 1.70–3.03)times significantly higher in the month of July–October and 1.43 (95%CI: 1.19–1.71) times higher in the month of November–February as compared to March–June (p < 0.001). Nasopharyngeal colonization with S. pneumoniae was also another important risk factor (HR = 1.18, 95%CI:1.01–1.39, p = 0.03).\nConclusion\nIn the current study, PWP-CP model was found to be better model as compared to other models. Also biologically appropriate as subsequent events depend on the first event of URI. Hence, the choice of an appropriate method for analyzing the recurrent event data should not be decided only on statistical basis but also based on the research question.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Thenmozhi","given":"Mani"},{"family":"Jeyaseelan","given":"Visalakshi"},{"family":"Jeyaseelan","given":"Lakshmanan"},{"family":"Isaac","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Vedantam","given":"Rupa"}],"citation-key":"thenmozhiSurvivalAnalysisLongitudinal2019","container-title":"Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health","container-title-short":"Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health","DOI":"10.1016/j.cegh.2019.01.013","ISSN":"2213-3984","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,1]]},"page":"253-260","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Survival analysis in longitudinal studies for recurrent events: Applications and challenges","title-short":"Survival analysis in longitudinal studies for recurrent events","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://cegh.net/article/S2213-3984(18)30218-5/pdf","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"thurnerNetworkbasedExplanationWhy2020","abstract":"Many countries have passed their first COVID-19 epidemic peak. Traditional epidemiological models describe this as a result of nonpharmaceutical interventions pushing the growth rate below the recovery rate. In this phase of the pandemic many countries showed an almost linear growth of confirmed cases for extended time periods. This new containment regime is hard to explain by traditional models where either infection numbers grow explosively until herd immunity is reached or the epidemic is completely suppressed. Here we offer an explanation of this puzzling observation based on the structure of contact networks. We show that for any given transmission rate there exists a critical number of social contacts, DcDc<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math>, below which linear growth and low infection prevalence must occur.

Daily market prices and financial technical indicators are utilized as inputs to predict the one day future closing price of individual stocks. The prediction of stock price movement is generally considered to be a challenging and important task for financial time series analysis. The accurate prediction of stock price movements could play an important role in helping investors improve stock returns. The complexity in predicting these trends lies in the inherent noise and volatility in daily stock price movement. The Bayesian regularized network assigns a probabilistic nature to the network weights, allowing the network to automatically and optimally penalize excessively complex models. The proposed technique reduces the potential for overfitting and overtraining, improving the prediction quality and generalization of the network. Experiments were performed with Microsoft Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. stock to determine the effectiveness of the model. The results indicate that the proposed model performs as well as the more advanced models without the need for preprocessing of data, seasonality testing, or cycle analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Ticknor","given":"Jonathan L."}],"citation-key":"ticknorBayesianRegularizedArtificial2013","container-title":"Expert Systems with Applications","container-title-short":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"10.1016/j.eswa.2013.04.013","ISSN":"0957-4174","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,10,15]]},"page":"5501-5506","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A Bayesian regularized artificial neural network for stock market forecasting","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417413002509","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"tomzCountriesDefaultBad2007","abstract":"This paper uses a new dataset to study the relationship between economic output and sovereign default for the period 1820–2004. We find a negative but surprisingly weak relationship between economic output in the borrowing country and default on loans from private foreign creditors. Throughout history, countries have indeed defaulted during bad times (when output was relatively low), but they have also suspended payments when the domestic economy was favorable, and they have maintained debt service in the face of adverse shocks. This constitutes a puzzle for standard theories of international debt, which predict a much tighter negative relationship as default provides partial insurance against declines in output.

  {"id":"tomzReputationInternationalCooperation2007","abstract":"How does cooperation emerge in a condition of international anarchy? Michael Tomz sheds new light on this fundamental question through a study of international debt across three centuries. Tomz develops a reputational theory of cooperation between sovereign governments and foreign investors. He explains how governments acquire reputations in the eyes of investors, and argues that concerns about reputation sustain international lending and repayment. Tomz's theory generates novel predictions about the dynamics of cooperation: how investors treat first-time borrowers, how access to credit evolves as debtors become more seasoned, and how countries ascend and descend the reputational ladder by acting contrary to investors' expectations. Tomz systematically tests his theory and the leading alternatives across three centuries of financial history. His remarkable data, gathered from archives in nine countries, cover all sovereign borrowers. He deftly combines statistical methods, case studies, and content analysis to scrutinize theories from as many angles as possible. Tomz finds strong support for his reputational theory while challenging prevailing views about sovereign debt. His pathbreaking study shows that, across the centuries, reputations have guided lending and repayment in consistent ways. Moreover, Tomz uncovers surprisingly little evidence of punitive enforcement strategies. Creditors have not compelled borrowers to repay by threatening military retaliation, imposing trade sanctions, or colluding to deprive defaulters of future loans. He concludes by highlighting the implications of his reputational logic for areas beyond sovereign debt, further advancing our understanding of the puzzle of cooperation under anarchy.","author":[{"family":"Tomz","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"tomzReputationInternationalCooperation2007","ISBN":"0-691-13469-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"325","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Reputation and International Cooperation: Sovereign Debt Across Three Centuries","title-short":"Reputation and International Cooperation","type":"book"},
  {"id":"trapidoHowNoveltyKnowledge2015","abstract":"The novelty of scientific or technological knowledge has a paradoxical dual implication. Highly novel ideas are subject to a higher risk of rejection by their evaluating audiences than incremental, “normal science” contributions. Yet the same audiences may deem a contribution to knowledge valuable because it is highly novel. This study develops and tests an explanation of this dual effect. It is argued that the recognition premium that highly acclaimed authors’ work enjoys disproportionately accrues to work that is consistent with the authors’ previously developed identity. Because high novelty is a salient identity marker, authors’ past recognition for highly novel work helps same authors’ new highly novel work earn positive audience valuation. It is further argued that, because recognition for novelty is partly inherited from mentors, disciples of highly acclaimed producers of novel work are more likely to have their work prized for its novelty. In contrast, the authors’ or their mentors’ recognition earned for relatively less novel work does not trigger similar spillover effects and leaves the authors vulnerable to the novelty discount. Unique data on the productivity, career histories, and mentoring relations of academic electrical engineers support these arguments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Trapido","given":"Denis"}],"citation-key":"trapidoHowNoveltyKnowledge2015","container-title":"Research Policy","container-title-short":"Research Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.respol.2015.05.007","ISSN":"0048-7333","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1488-1500","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"How novelty in knowledge earns recognition: The role of consistent identities","title-short":"How novelty in knowledge earns recognition","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315000839","volume":"44"},

We investigate the influence of common attributes at the dyad level in terms of assortativity coefficients and regression models. We then examine larger-scale groupings by detecting communities algorithmically and comparing them to network partitions based on user characteristics. We thereby examine the relative importance of different characteristics at different institutions, finding for example that common high school is more important to the social organization of large institutions and that the importance of common major varies significantly between institutions. Our calculations illustrate how microscopic and macroscopic perspectives give complementary insights on the social organization at universities and suggest future studies to investigate such phenomena further.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Traud","given":"Amanda L."},{"family":"Mucha","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Porter","given":"Mason A."}],"citation-key":"traudSocialStructureFacebook2012","container-title":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","container-title-short":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","DOI":"10.1016/j.physa.2011.12.021","ISSN":"0378-4371","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,15]]},"page":"4165-4180","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Social structure of Facebook networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437111009186","volume":"391"},

Three variables are used as indicators of social isolation: separated/divorced marital status, migration status, and unemployment.

Separated/divorced marital status demonstrated a global positive influence. Migration and unemployment effects ranged from positive to negative across the United States, showing some geographic clustering. The findings suggest regional variation is masked by global models and the effect of social isolation indicators have on suicide may vary with geographic context.

This paper considers methodological and conceptual challenges for this emergent field, with special attention to the validity and representativeness of social media big data analyses. Persistent issues include the over-emphasis of a single platform, Twitter, sampling biases arising from selection by hashtags, and vague and unrepresentative sampling frames. The socio-cultural complexity of user behavior aimed at algorithmic invisibility (such as subtweeting, mock-retweeting, use of “screen captures” for text, etc.) further complicate interpretation of big data social media. Other challenges include accounting for field effects, i.e. broadly consequential events that do not diffuse only through the network under study but affect the whole society. The application of network methods from other fields to the study of human social activity may not always be appropriate. The paper concludes with a call to action on practical steps to improve our analytic capacity in this promising, rapidly-growing field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Tufekci","given":"Zeynep"}],"citation-key":"tufekciBigQuestionsSocial2014","container-title":"Eighth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media","event":"Eighth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,5,16]]},"language":"en","source":"www.aaai.org","title":"Big Questions for Social Media Big Data: Representativeness, Validity and Other Methodological Pitfalls","title-short":"Big Questions for Social Media Big Data","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/view/8062"},

We examined the relationship between Internet message board activity and abnormal stock returns and trading volume in the period from mid-April 1999 to mid-February 2000. Our study focused on the Raging Bull.com discussion forum, an extremely popular site whose format permits the construction of an objective measure of investor opinions. For stocks in the Internet service sector, we found that on days with abnormally high message activity, changes in investor opinion correlated with abnormal industry-adjusted returns. These event days also coincided with abnormally high trading volume, which persisted for a second day. However, we found that message board activity did not predict industry-adjusted returns or abnormal trading volume, which is consistent with market efficiency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Tumarkin","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Whitelaw","given":"Robert F."}],"citation-key":"tumarkinNewsNoiseInternet2001","container-title":"Financial Analysts Journal","container-title-short":"Financial Analysts Journal","ISSN":"0015-198X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"page":"41-51","source":"JSTOR","title":"News or Noise?

  {"id":"tumminelloStatisticallyValidatedNetworks2011","abstract":"Many complex systems present an intrinsic bipartite structure where elements of one set link to elements of the second set. In these complex systems, such as the system of actors and movies, elements of one set are qualitatively different than elements of the other set. The properties of these complex systems are typically investigated by constructing and analyzing a projected network on one of the two sets (for example the actor network or the movie network). Complex systems are often very heterogeneous in the number of relationships that the elements of one set establish with the elements of the other set, and this heterogeneity makes it very difficult to discriminate links of the projected network that are just reflecting system's heterogeneity from links relevant to unveil the properties of the system. Here we introduce an unsupervised method to statistically validate each link of a projected network against a null hypothesis that takes into account system heterogeneity. We apply the method to a biological, an economic and a social complex system. The method we propose is able to detect network structures which are very informative about the organization and specialization of the investigated systems, and identifies those relationships between elements of the projected network that cannot be explained simply by system heterogeneity. We also show that our method applies to bipartite systems in which different relationships might have different qualitative nature, generating statistically validated networks in which such difference is preserved.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Tumminello","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Miccichè","given":"Salvatore"},{"family":"Lillo","given":"Fabrizio"},{"family":"Piilo","given":"Jyrki"},{"family":"Mantegna","given":"Rosario N."}],"citation-key":"tumminelloStatisticallyValidatedNetworks2011","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0017994","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,3,31]]},"page":"e17994","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Statistically Validated Networks in Bipartite Complex Systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017994","volume":"6"},

In this paper, the effects of this divide on journal publishing are reviewed in terms of the consequences of the Big Divide for the discipline.

  {"id":"uzziAtypicalCombinationsScientific2013","abstract":"Making an Impact\nHow big a role do unconventional combinations of existing knowledge play in the impact of a scientific paper? To examine this question, Uzzi et al. (p. 468) studied 17.9 million research articles across five decades of the Web of Science, the largest repository of scientific research. Scientific work typically appeared to draw on highly conventional, familiar mixtures of knowledge. The highest-impact papers were not the ones that had the greatest novelty, but had a combination of novelty and otherwise conventional combinations of prior work.\nNovelty is an essential feature of creative ideas, yet the building blocks of new ideas are often embodied in existing knowledge. From this perspective, balancing atypical knowledge with conventional knowledge may be critical to the link between innovativeness and impact. Our analysis of 17.9 million papers spanning all scientific fields suggests that science follows a nearly universal pattern: The highest-impact science is primarily grounded in exceptionally conventional combinations of prior work yet simultaneously features an intrusion of unusual combinations. Papers of this type were twice as likely to be highly cited works. Novel combinations of prior work are rare, yet teams are 37.7% more likely than solo authors to insert novel combinations into familiar knowledge domains.\nHighly cited work is simultaneously conventional and unconventional.\nHighly cited work is simultaneously conventional and unconventional.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Uzzi","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Mukherjee","given":"Satyam"},{"family":"Stringer","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Ben"}],"citation-key":"uzziAtypicalCombinationsScientific2013","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.1240474","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6157","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,10,25]]},"language":"en","page":"468-472","PMID":"24159044","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"Atypical Combinations and Scientific Impact","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6157/468","volume":"342"},

(1) in PNAS provides another example of the potential effectiveness of using network theory and data to implement health-promoting interventions. There are many such examples across the health and medical literatures addressing a variety of health behaviors. While the study by Chami et al. (1) uses a strategy of individual change agent identification, other strategies and tactics using network concepts and data have been used (2).\n\nAdvances and progress with network interventions have been slowed precisely due to the variety of applications and the variety of approaches. Example applications include HIV/sexually transmitted infections; contraceptive use; tobacco, alcohol, and other substance use; physician behaviors regarding reproductive health; acute myocardial infarction; and kidney disease. So, rather than advancing network intervention theory, scientists continue to replicate approaches in new settings and new applications. Consequently, we now know that selecting influential nodes in a network results in superior intervention effectiveness. We also know that even slightly better nodes from a network perspective are better than nodes chosen randomly: a finding demonstrated with simulations (3) and empirical examples (4).\n\nThe many studies identified by Valente and Pumpang (5) over 10 y ago and the more recent review by Flodgren et al.

  {"id":"vandenbesselaarEarlyCareerGrants2015","abstract":"The main rationale behind career grants is helping top talent to develop into the next generation leading scientists. Does career grant competition result in the selection of the best young talents? In this paper we investigate whether the selected applicants are indeed performing at the expected excellent level—something that is hardly investigated in the research literature. We investigate the predictive validity of grant decision-making, using a sample of 260 early career grant applications in three social science fields. We measure output and impact of the applicants about ten years after the application to find out whether the selected researchers perform ex post better than the non-successful ones. Overall, we find that predictive validity is low to moderate when comparing grantees with all non-successful applicants. Comparing grantees with the best performing non-successful applicants, predictive validity is absent. This implies that the common belief that peers in selection panels are good in recognizing outstanding talents is incorrect. We also investigate the effects of the grants on careers and show that recipients of the grants do have a better career than the non-granted applicants. This makes the observed lack of predictive validity even more problematic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Besselaar","given":"Peter","non-dropping-particle":"van den"},{"family":"Sandström","given":"Ulf"}],"citation-key":"vandenbesselaarEarlyCareerGrants2015","container-title":"Journal of Informetrics","container-title-short":"Journal of Informetrics","DOI":"10.1016/j.joi.2015.07.011","ISSN":"1751-1577","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,1]]},"page":"826-838","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Early career grants, performance, and careers: A study on predictive validity of grant decisions","title-short":"Early career grants, performance, and careers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157715300067","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"vandenbesselaarGenderDifferencesResearch2016","abstract":"We take up the issue of performance differences between male and female researchers, and investigate the change of performance differences during the early career. In a previous paper it was shown that among starting researchers gendered performance differences seem small to non-existent (Van Arensbergen et al. 2012). If the differences do not occur in the early career anymore, they may emerge in a later period, or may remain absent. In this paper we use the same sample of male and female researchers, but now compare performance levels about 10 years later. We use various performance indicators: full/fractional counted productivity, citation impact, and relative citation impact in terms of the share of papers in the top 10 % highly cited papers. After the 10 years period, productivity of male researchers has grown faster than of female researcher, but the field normalized (relative) citation impact indicators of male and female researchers remain about equal. Furthermore, performance data do explain to a certain extent why male careers in our sample develop much faster than female researchers’ careers; but controlling for performance differences, we find that gender is an important determinant too. Consequently, the process of hiring academic staff still remains biased.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Besselaar","given":"Peter","non-dropping-particle":"van den"},{"family":"Sandström","given":"Ulf"}],"citation-key":"vandenbesselaarGenderDifferencesResearch2016","container-title":"Scientometrics","container-title-short":"Scientometrics","DOI":"10.1007/s11192-015-1775-3","ISSN":"1588-2861","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"143-162","source":"Springer Link","title":"Gender differences in research performance and its impact on careers: a longitudinal case study","title-short":"Gender differences in research performance and its impact on careers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-015-1775-3","volume":"106"},

Sociologists emphasize between- and within-person variability in lived experiences and normative heterogeneity as essential for understanding behavioral change. Sociological approaches then begin with the assumption that variability in the timing, history, cohort, and normative circumstances surrounding individuals’ peer contexts is critical for the measurement, meaning, and influence of peer relationships on behavior. In this chapter, we summarize theories, methods, and research on peer relationships and social development, with a primary focus on the adolescent life stage. Throughout, we emphasize the interdependence of social action (i.e., linked lives), environmental context, and individual agency when understanding the intersection of peers and adolescent behavioral trajectories. These foci distinguish this chapter from others in the volume and provide an important counterpoint to research firmly embedded in the developmental psychology tradition. To organize our discussion, we further divide each of our sections using three interrelated theoretical lenses—the social pathways, social networks, and social norms perspectives—which we define as follows.

  {"id":"vestalTechnologicalDistanceBreakthrough2022","abstract":"Multi-cluster R&D teams have the potential to generate breakthrough inventions because they can tap into the distinct knowledge of the different geographic hot spots in which team members are located. Having access to a variety of knowledge offers these teams great recombinatorial potential. To succeed, however, the geographically dispersed members must share and integrate the different local knowledge pools available to them. We argue that the density of intra-team co-patenting ties shapes intra-team knowledge sharing and integration and hence the extent teams benefit from the knowledge they can access. Whereas greater density of intra-cluster team ties (within a given location) hinders sharing and integration of locally tapped knowledge across locations, greater density of inter-cluster ties (across cluster locations) facilitates it. Our empirical analysis of 834 multi-cluster nanotechnology R&D teams shows that the technological distance (the difference in knowledge) between clusters in which inventors are located has an inverted-U relationship with the likelihood of the team generating a breakthrough. Further, we find that the density of multi-cluster team intra- vs. inter-cluster ties influences the effect of technological distance on the likelihood of breakthrough invention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Vestal","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Danneels","given":"Erwin"}],"citation-key":"vestalTechnologicalDistanceBreakthrough2022","container-title":"Administrative Science Quarterly","container-title-short":"Administrative Science Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/00018392211027512","ISSN":"0001-8392","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"167-206","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Technological Distance and Breakthrough Inventions in Multi-Cluster Teams: How Intra- and Inter-Location Ties Bridge the Gap","title-short":"Technological Distance and Breakthrough Inventions in Multi-Cluster Teams","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00018392211027512","volume":"67"},

  {"id":"vijayakumarAssessingReplicabilityMachine2019","abstract":"Machine learning methods have become very popular in diverse fields due to their focus on predictive accuracy, but little work has been conducted on how to assess the replicability of their findings. We introduce and adapt replication methods advocated in psychology to the aims and procedural needs of machine learning research. In Study 1, we illustrate these methods with the use of an empirical data set, assessing the replication success of a predictive accuracy measure, namely, R 2 on the cross-validated and test sets of the samples. We introduce three replication aims. First, tests of inconsistency examine whether single replications have successfully rejected the original study. Rejection will be supported if the 95% confidence interval (CI) of R 2 difference estimates between replication and original does not contain zero. Second, tests of consistency help support claims of successful replication. We can decide apriori on a region of equivalence, where population values of the difference estimates are considered equivalent for substantive reasons. The 90% CI of a different estimate lying fully within this region supports replication. Third, we show how to combine replications to construct meta-analytic intervals for better precision of predictive accuracy measures. In Study 2, R 2 is reduced from the original in a subset of replication studies to examine the ability of the replication procedures to distinguish true replications from nonreplications. We find that when combining studies sampled from same population to form meta-analytic intervals, random-effects methods perform best for cross-validated measures while fixed-effects methods work best for test measures. Among machine learning methods, regression was comparable to many complex methods, while support vector machine performed most reliably across a variety of scenarios. Social scientists who use machine learning to model empirical data can use these methods to enhance the reliability of their findings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Vijayakumar","given":"Ranjith"},{"family":"Cheung","given":"Mike W.-L."}],"citation-key":"vijayakumarAssessingReplicabilityMachine2019","container-title":"Social Science Computer Review","container-title-short":"Social Science Computer Review","DOI":"10.1177/0894439319888445","ISSN":"0894-4393","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,9]]},"language":"en","page":"0894439319888445","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Assessing Replicability of Machine Learning Results: An Introduction to Methods on Predictive Accuracy in Social Sciences","title-short":"Assessing Replicability of Machine Learning Results","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439319888445"},

Do Esping-Andersen’s ‘Three Worlds’ exist empirically if one considers a comprehensive set of formal institutions simultaneously? And if so, do such regimes coincide with coherent differences in people’s value orientations in this field, or informal cultures? In order to answer these questions, nonlinear principal components analysis was applied to a group of countries at the core of the original Esping-Andersen typology. Nonlinear PCA seems to be a promising tool for comparative research because the technique is able to handle discrete data and nonlinear relationships, and the number of variables can exceed the number of countries. The outcomes of the analyses suggest that the ‘Three Worlds’ of formal social security had a firm empirical basis in the 1990s, and that the typology remains largely valid today, albeit with some qualifications. Furthermore, three different informal ‘cultures of social security’ emerged, with country clusters quite similar to those of the structural regime typology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Vrooman","given":"J.

  {"id":"vuInverseGenerativeSocial2019","abstract":"Generative mechanism-based models of social systems, such as those represented by agent-based simulations, require that intra-agent equations (or rules) be specified. However there are often many different choices available for specifying these equations, which can still be interpreted as falling within a particular class of mechanisms. Whilst it is important for a generative model to reproduce historically observed dynamics, it is also important for the model to be theoretically enlightening. Genetic programs (our own included) often produce concatenations that are highly predictive but are complex and hard to interpret theoretically. Here, we develop a new method - based on multi-objective genetic programming - for automating the exploration of both objectives simultaneously. We demonstrate the method by evolving the equations for an existing agent-based simulation of alcohol use behaviors based on social norms theory, the initial model structure for which was developed by a team of human modelers. We discover a trade-off between empirical fit and theoretical interpretability that offers insight into the social norms processes that influence the change and stasis in alcohol use behaviors over time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Vu","given":"Tuong Manh"},{"family":"Probst","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Epstein","given":"Joshua M."},{"family":"Brennan","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Strong","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Purshouse","given":"Robin C."}],"citation-key":"vuInverseGenerativeSocial2019","collection-title":"GECCO '19","container-title":"Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference","DOI":"10.1145/3321707.3321840","event-place":"Prague, Czech Republic","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6111-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,13]]},"page":"1356–1363","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"Prague, Czech Republic","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Toward inverse generative social science using multi-objective genetic programming","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3321707.3321840"},

Finally, a suite of new temporal and network statistics is introduced to reflect the potentially complex dependencies among events and observed heterogeneities on nodes and edges.\n\nThe empirical value of new extensions is demonstrated through an analysis of social learning in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). In particular, three modeling problems are considered from the network perspective: (1) the utility of social factors, performance indicators, and clickstream behaviors in the prediction of course dropout, (2) the social and temporal structure of learner interactions across discussion threads, and (3) the forms of mutual dependence of social learning interactions on prior learning success, and future learning success on forms of prior social learning interaction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Vu","given":"Duy"},{"family":"Pattison","given":"Philippa"},{"family":"Robins","given":"Garry"}],"citation-key":"vuRelationalEventModels2015","container-title":"Social Networks","container-title-short":"Social Networks","DOI":"10.1016/j.socnet.2015.05.001","ISSN":"0378-8733","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,10]]},"page":"121-135","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Relational event models for social learning in MOOCs","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873315000477","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"wagnerApproachesUnderstandingMeasuring2011","abstract":"Interdisciplinary scientific research (IDR) extends and challenges the study of science on a number of fronts, including creating output science and engineering (S&E) indicators. This literature review began with a narrow search for quantitative measures of the output of IDR that could contribute to indicators, but the authors expanded the scope of the review as it became clear that differing definitions, assessment tools, evaluation processes, and measures all shed light on different aspects of IDR. Key among these broader aspects is (a) the importance of incorporating the concept of knowledge integration, and (b) recognizing that integration can occur within a single mind as well as among a team. Existing output measures alone cannot adequately capture this process. Among the quantitative measures considered, bibliometrics (co-authorships, co-inventors, collaborations, references, citations and co-citations) are the most developed, but leave considerable gaps in understanding of the social dynamics that lead to knowledge integration. Emerging measures in network dynamics (particularly betweenness centrality and diversity), and entropy are promising as indicators, but their use requires sophisticated interpretations. Combinations of quantitative measures and qualitative assessments being applied within evaluation studies appear to reveal IDR processes but carry burdens of expense, intrusion, and lack of reproducibility year-upon-year. This review is a first step toward providing a more holistic view of measuring IDR, although research and development is needed before metrics can adequately reflect the actual phenomenon of IDR.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Wagner","given":"Caroline S."},{"family":"Roessner","given":"J.

We deduced rivaling predictions from intergroup contact and intergroup threat theories that could explain the occurrence of xenophobic hate crimes. By combining structural data of the 402 German districts with the 2015 police crime statistics, we found evidence to support our predictions that aligns with intergroup contact theory: the higher the proportion of foreigners in a district, the lower the prevalence of xenophobic hate crimes. Our analyses further show that the prevalence of xenophobic hate crime attacks was positively related to the total prevalence of registered criminal offenses in a district and was higher in eastern German districts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Wagner","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Tachtsoglou","given":"Sarantis"},{"family":"Kotzur","given":"Patrick Ferdinand"},{"family":"Friehs","given":"Maria-Therese"},{"family":"Kemmesies","given":"Uwe"}],"citation-key":"wagnerProportionForeignersNegatively2020","container-title":"Social Psychology Quarterly","container-title-short":"Soc Psychol Q","DOI":"10.1177/0190272519887719","ISSN":"0190-2725","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,13]]},"language":"en","page":"0190272519887719","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Proportion of Foreigners Negatively Predicts the Prevalence of Xenophobic Hate Crimes Within German Districts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0190272519887719"},

  {"id":"walBestBothWorlds2016","abstract":"Open networks give actors non-redundant information that is diverse, while closed networks offer redundant information that is easier to interpret. Integrating arguments about network structure and the similarity of actors’ knowledge, we propose two types of network configurations that combine diversity and ease of interpretation. Closed-diverse networks offer diversity in actors’ knowledge domains and shared third-party ties to help in interpreting that knowledge. In open-specialized networks, structural holes offer diversity, while shared interpretive schema and overlap between received information and actors’ prior knowledge help in interpreting new information without the help of third parties. In contrast, actors in open-diverse networks suffer from information overload due to the lack of shared schema or overlapping prior knowledge for the interpretation of diverse information, and actors in closed-specialized networks suffer from overembeddedness because they cannot access diverse information. Using CrunchBase data on early-stage venture capital investments in the U.S. information technology sector, we test the effect of investors’ social capital on the success of their portfolio ventures. We find that ventures have the highest chances of success if their syndicating investors have either open-specialized or closed-diverse networks. These effects are manifested beyond the direct effects of ventures’ or investors’ quality and are robust to controlling for the possibility that certain investors could have chosen more promising ventures at the time of first funding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Wal","given":"Anne L.

  {"id":"walkerSocialCapitalStructural1997","abstract":"The formation of a network is determined by the opposition of two forces. The first is the reproduction of network structure as a general social resource for network members. The second is the alteration of network structure by entrepreneurs for their own benefit. The idea of reproduction is a conventional one in organizational sociology but has taken on increased importance due to the work of Bourdieu and Coleman. In contrast, Burt stresses the entrepreneurship of individual agents in exploiting structural holes that lie between constrained positions. Though complementary, the theories of social capital and structural holes have fundamentally different implications for network formation. This paper investigates these theories by examining empirically the formation of the interorganizational network among biotechnology firms. We propose that network structure determines the frequency with which a new biotechnology firm (or startup) establishes new relationships. Network structure indicates both where social capital is distributed in the industry and where opportunities for entrepreneurial action are located. The reproduction of network structure depends on how startups value social capital compared to these opportunities. The critical test is, consequently, whether new relationships reproduce or alter the inherited network structure. We find strong support for the power of social capital in reproducing the network over time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Walker","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Kogut","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Shan","given":"Weijian"}],"citation-key":"walkerSocialCapitalStructural1997","container-title":"Organization Science","container-title-short":"Organization Science","ISSN":"1047-7039","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1997]]},"page":"109-125","source":"JSTOR","title":"Social Capital, Structural Holes and the Formation of an Industry Network","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2635305","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"wallaceApartheidSpreadAIDS1995","abstract":"We compare mechanisms of AIDS diffusion at the county level from five U.S. central city epicenters into their associated metropolitan regions. Four of the five show an expanding ‘hollowed out’ center of physically and socially devastated, politically and economically abandoned high density minority neighborhoods, surrounded by rings of relatively affluent majority suburban populations. From these centers AIDS diffuses into the suburbs as a single, spatially extended disease ecosystem. The exception, San Francisco, has not yet experienced the ‘hollowing out’ process and is, we conclude, a major AIDS epicenter markedly less coupled to its suburbs because of that fact. This may constitute one of the few empirical observations of spatial threshold in epidemiology. Our empirical results contradict the conclusions of a recent National Research Council report that AIDS will be largely confined within marginalized urban populations. In reality U.S. urban apartheid, particularly its continuing disruption of minority social structures, has markedly accelerated the diffusion of AIDS into suburban communities. A widespread program of reform, which rebuilds minority physical and social community structures within both city and suburb, is an essential, but largely unrecognized, component to any serious strategy for the control of AIDS in the United States.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Wallace","given":"Rodrick"},{"family":"Wallace","given":"Deborah"}],"citation-key":"wallaceApartheidSpreadAIDS1995","container-title":"Social Science & Medicine","container-title-short":"Social Science & Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/0277-9536(94)00349-X","ISSN":"0277-9536","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995,8,1]]},"page":"333-345","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"U.S. Apartheid and the spread of AIDS to the suburbs: A multi-city analysis of the political economy of spatial epidemic threshold","title-short":"U.S. Apartheid and the spread of AIDS to the suburbs","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/027795369400349X","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"wangExponentialRandomGraph2013","abstract":"Modern multilevel analysis, whereby outcomes of individuals within groups take into account group membership, has been accompanied by impressive theoretical development (e.g. Kozlowski and Klein, 2000) and sophisticated methodology (e.g. Snijders and Bosker, 2012). But typically the approach assumes that links between groups are non-existent, and interdependence among the individuals derives solely from common group membership. It is not plausible that such groups have no internal structure nor they have no links between each other. Networks provide a more complex representation of interdependence. Drawing on a small but crucial body of existing work, we present a general formulation of a multilevel network structure. We extend exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to multilevel networks, and investigate the properties of the proposed models using simulations which show that even very simple meso effects can create structure at one or both levels. We use an empirical example of a collaboration network about French cancer research elites and their affiliations (Lazega et al., 2006, 2008) to demonstrate that a full understanding of the network structure requires the cross-level parameters.

This paper studies the association between the degree of interdisciplinarity and the number of citations at the paper level. Different from previous studies compositing various aspects of interdisciplinarity into a single indicator, we use factor analysis to uncover distinct dimensions of interdisciplinarity corresponding to variety, balance, and disparity. We estimate Poisson models with journal fixed effects and robust standard errors to analyze the divergent relationships between these three factors and citations. We find that long-term (13-year) citations (1) increase at an increasing rate with variety, (2) decrease with balance, and (3) increase at a decreasing rate with disparity. Furthermore, interdisciplinarity also affects the process of citation accumulation: (1) although variety and disparity have positive effects on long-term citations, they have negative effects on short-term (3-year) citations, and (2) although balance has a negative effect on long-term citations, its negative effect is insignificant in the short run.

By drawing on the minority threat perspective, this article investigates the effects of objective and perceptual measures of community context on perceived criminal threat from undocumented immigrants. Analyses of data collected from four Southwest states and the U.S. Census show that the perceived size of the undocumented immigrant population, more so than the actual size of the immigrant population and economic conditions, is positively associated with perceptions of undocumented immigrants as a criminal threat. Additional analyses show that objective measures of community context do not affect native respondents’ perceptions of the size of the undocumented immigrant population.

  {"id":"warrenHowMuchYou2019","abstract":"Many sociologists suspect that publication expectations have risen over time—that how much graduate students have published to get assistant professor jobs and how much assistant professors have published to be promoted have gone up. Using information about faculty in 21 top sociology departments from the American Sociological Association’s Guide to Graduate Departments of Sociology, online curricula vitae, and other public records, I provide empirical evidence to support this suspicion.

  {"id":"warrenliaoClusteringTimeSeries2005","abstract":"Time series clustering has been shown effective in providing useful information in various domains. There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested in advancing this area of research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Warren Liao","given":"T."}],"citation-key":"warrenliaoClusteringTimeSeries2005","container-title":"Pattern Recognition","container-title-short":"Pattern Recognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.patcog.2005.01.025","ISSN":"0031-3203","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,11]]},"page":"1857-1874","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Clustering of time series data—a survey","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320305001305","volume":"38"},

We refer to such procedures as “universal.” The method is very simple and is based on a modified version of the usual likelihood-ratio statistic that we call “the split likelihood-ratio test” (split LRT) statistic. The (limiting) null distribution of the classical likelihood-ratio statistic is often intractable when used to test composite null hypotheses in irregular statistical models. Our method is especially appealing for statistical inference in these complex setups. The method we suggest works for any parametric model and also for some nonparametric models, as long as computing a maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) is feasible under the null. Canonical examples arise in mixture modeling and shape-constrained inference, for which constructing tests and confidence sets has been notoriously difficult. We also develop various extensions of our basic methods. We show that in settings when computing the MLE is hard, for the purpose of constructing valid tests and intervals, it is sufficient to upper bound the maximum likelihood. We investigate some conditions under which our methods yield valid inferences under model misspecification. Further, the split LRT can be used with profile likelihoods to deal with nuisance parameters, and it can also be run sequentially to yield anytime-valid P values and confidence sequences. Finally, when combined with the method of sieves, it can be used to perform model selection with nested model classes.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Larry"},{"family":"Ramdas","given":"Aaditya"},{"family":"Balakrishnan","given":"Sivaraman"}],"citation-key":"wassermanUniversalInference2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1922664117","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,6]]},"language":"en","PMID":"32631986","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Physical Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Universal inference","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/07/02/1922664117"},

  {"id":"watsonInvestigatingPotentiallyContradictory2009","abstract":"Abstract The existing academic literature on financialization points to multiple instances in which firms attempt to demonstrate the vitality of their stock-market position in ways which ultimately prove to be self-harming. I demonstrate, in the first instance as a matt er of immanent logic, that these actions are linked to the interplay of contradictory tendencies in the microfoundations of financialization. Under conditions of financialization, firms create additional sources of credit to capitalize their productive activities by driving their stock price into greater increases than the market average, thereby generating capital gains. Yet, the more it becomes public knowledge that the financing tricks used to inflate the stock price provide no productive benefit to the firm, the more it would seem to create incentives for fund managers to hold portfolios that replicate the stock market as a whole. In this way, they will minimize their exposure to financial misrepresentation. Such a stance undermines financialized business models, but it does in any case conform to fund managers? basic theoretical training, which revolves around the logical demonstration that an individual stock cannot systematically out-perform the market average. I review the available empirical studies of fund manager decision-making to show that they find against the existence of a simple performativity loop operating between finance theory and fund manager behaviour. However, on many points the empirical evidence does confirm the theoretically derived conclusion concerning the potentially contradictory microfoundations of financialization. Fund managers often do act in a way which is consistent with finance theory's core claim that an index-tracking strategy represents the only equilibrium portfolio, even if this is only rarely as a result of the direct performativity of the theory.","author":[{"family":"Watson","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"watsonInvestigatingPotentiallyContradictory2009","container-title":"Economy and Society","DOI":"10.1080/03085140902786728","ISSN":"0308-5147","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"255-277","source":"Taylor&Francis","title":"Investigating the potentially contradictory microfoundations of financialization","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03085140902786728","volume":"38"},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon, (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability.

  {"id":"wattsCommonSenseSociological2014","abstract":"Sociologists have long advocated a sociological approach to explanation by contrasting it with common sense. The argument of this article, however, is that sociologists rely on common sense more than they realize. Moreover, this unacknowledged reliance causes serious problems for their explanations of social action, that is, for why people do what they do. Many such explanations, it is argued, conflate understandability with causality in ways that are not valid by the standards of scientific explanation. It follows that if sociologists want their explanations to be scientifically valid, they must evaluate them specifically on those grounds—in particular, by forcing them to make predictions. In becoming more scientific, however, it is predicted that sociologists’ explanations will also become less satisfying from an intuitive, sense-making perspective. Even as novel sources of data and improved methods open exciting new directions for sociological research, therefore, sociologists will increasingly have to choose between unsatisfying scientific explanations and satisfying but unscientific stories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Watts","given":"Duncan J."}],"citation-key":"wattsCommonSenseSociological2014","container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","container-title-short":"American Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1086/678271","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,1]]},"page":"313-351","source":"JSTOR","title":"Common Sense and Sociological Explanations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/678271","volume":"120"},

  {"id":"wayGenderProductivityPrestige2016","abstract":"Women are dramatically underrepresented in computer science at all levels in academia and account for just 15% of tenure-track faculty. Understanding the causes of this gender imbalance would inform both policies intended to rectify it and employment decisions by departments and individuals. Progress in this direction, however, is complicated by the complexity and decentralized nature of faculty hiring and the non-independence of hires. Using comprehensive data on both hiring outcomes and scholarly productivity for 2659 tenure-track faculty across 205 Ph.D.-granting departments in North America, we investigate the multi-dimensional nature of gender inequality in computer science faculty hiring through a network model of the hiring process. Overall, we find that hiring outcomes are most directly affected by (i) the relative prestige between hiring and placing institutions and (ii) the scholarly productivity of the candidates. After including these, and other features, the addition of gender did not significantly reduce modeling error. However, gender differences do exist, e.g., in scholarly productivity, postdoctoral training rates, and in career movements up the rankings of universities, suggesting that the effects of gender are indirectly incorporated into hiring decisions through gender's covariates. Furthermore, we find evidence that more highly ranked departments recruit female faculty at higher than expected rates, which appears to inhibit similar efforts by lower ranked departments. These findings illustrate the subtle nature of gender inequality in faculty hiring networks and provide new insights to the underrepresentation of women in computer science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Way","given":"Samuel F."},{"family":"Larremore","given":"Daniel B."},{"family":"Clauset","given":"Aaron"}],"citation-key":"wayGenderProductivityPrestige2016","collection-title":"WWW '16","container-title":"Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web","DOI":"10.1145/2872427.2883073","event-place":"Montréal, Québec, Canada","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4143-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,11]]},"page":"1169–1179","publisher":"International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee","publisher-place":"Montréal, Québec, Canada","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Gender, Productivity, and Prestige in Computer Science Faculty Hiring Networks","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2872427.2883073"},

Sixty years of studies on career productivity patterns in a variety of fields suggest an intuitive and universal pattern: Productivity tends to rise rapidly to an early peak and then gradually declines. Here, we test the universality of this conventional narrative by analyzing the structures of individual faculty productivity time series, constructed from over 200,000 publications and matched with hiring data for 2,453 tenure-track faculty in all 205 PhD-granting computer science departments in the United States and Canada. Unlike prior studies, which considered only some faculty or some institutions, or lacked common career reference points, here we combine a large bibliographic dataset with comprehensive information on career transitions that covers an entire field of study. We show that the conventional narrative confidently describes only one-fifth of faculty, regardless of department prestige or researcher gender, and the remaining four-fifths of faculty exhibit a rich diversity of productivity patterns. To explain this diversity, we introduce a simple model of productivity trajectories and explore correlations between its parameters and researcher covariates, showing that departmental prestige predicts overall individual productivity and the timing of the transition from first- to last-author publications. These results demonstrate the unpredictability of productivity over time and open the door for new efforts to understand how environmental and individual factors shape scientific productivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Way","given":"Samuel F."},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Allison C."},{"family":"Clauset","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Larremore","given":"Daniel B."}],"citation-key":"wayMisleadingNarrativeCanonical2017","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1702121114","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"44","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,31]]},"language":"en","page":"E9216-E9223","PMID":"29042510","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"PNAS Plus","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"The misleading narrative of the canonical faculty productivity trajectory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/114/44/E9216","volume":"114"},
  {"id":"wayProductivityProminenceEffects2019","abstract":"Faculty at prestigious institutions produce more scientific papers, receive more citations and scholarly awards, and are typically trained at more-prestigious institutions than faculty with less prestigious appointments. This imbalance is often attributed to a meritocratic system that sorts individuals into more-prestigious positions according to their reputation, past achievements, and potential for future scholarly impact. Here, we investigate the determinants of scholarly productivity and measure their dependence on past training and current work environments. To distinguish the effects of these environments, we apply a matched-pairs experimental design to career and productivity trajectories of 2,453 early-career faculty at all 205 PhD-granting computer science departments in the United States and Canada, who together account for over 200,000 publications and 7.4 million citations. Our results show that the prestige of faculty’s current work environment, not their training environment, drives their future scientific productivity, while current and past locations drive prominence. Furthermore, the characteristics of a work environment are more predictive of faculty productivity and impact than mechanisms representing preferential selection or retention of more-productive scholars by more-prestigious departments. These results identify an environmental mechanism for cumulative advantage, in which an individual’s past successes are “locked in” via placement into a more prestigious environment, which directly facilitates future success. The scientific productivity of early-career faculty is thus driven by where they work, rather than where they trained for their doctorate, indicating a limited role for doctoral prestige in predicting scientific contributions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Way","given":"Samuel F."},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Allison C."},{"family":"Larremore","given":"Daniel B."},{"family":"Clauset","given":"Aaron"}],"citation-key":"wayProductivityProminenceEffects2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1817431116","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,28]]},"language":"en","page":"10729-10733","PMID":"31036658","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Social Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Productivity, prominence, and the effects of academic environment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/22/10729","volume":"116"},

  {"id":"weberStepbyStepProcedureImplement2019","abstract":"Discrete choice experiment (DCE) is a well-established technique to elicit stated preferences. It is frequently used in social sciences, where revealed preferences are difficult or sometimes even impossible to collect. A DCE consists in a series of choice tasks, in which survey respondents are requested to select the alternative they prefer among a few ones. Even though DCEs are conceptually well-known and documented, the practitioner may face technical issues once turning to their concrete implementation. This methodological note provides a step-by-step procedure to implement a DCE using the survey software Qualtrics. The procedure is largely automated, relying on the statistical software Stata and using HTML code to display the choice tasks in a pleasant way. Basic knowledge of Stata and HTML is desirable but not an absolute requirement. This note is intended to Qualtrics users, and prior knowledge of this survey tool is therefore assumed. A full working example with all codes and material is provided and presented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Weber","given":"Sylvain"}],"citation-key":"weberStepbyStepProcedureImplement2019","container-title":"Social Science Computer Review","container-title-short":"Social Science Computer Review","DOI":"10.1177/0894439319885317","ISSN":"0894-4393","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,3]]},"language":"en","page":"0894439319885317","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"A Step-by-Step Procedure to Implement Discrete Choice Experiments in Qualtrics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439319885317"},

What is research? What is quality research? What skills are required to produce a quality manuscript? What role does the journal system serve and how does it work? How are manuscripts refereed? What do professors at research universities do? How are they evaluated and rewarded? What does it take to be successful as a scholar at a research-oriented academic institution? These and other issues are effectively addressed through the 28 thought-provoking yet entertaining essays of unusually consistent quality contained in Publishing in the Organizational Sciences. The essays are timeless, promoting journeys and treks through a landscape that is otherwise unlikely to be encountered. Students love the book and the conversations it promotes. I cannot think of a more appropriate vehicle for introducing these critically important issues to the next generation of scholars in the organizational sciences.\" --Robert W.

Some of the topics covered in this provocative volume are the manuscript review process, publication system, newcomers′ perspectives, values, reviewing manuscripts, rejection, becoming a reviewer, and editorial process. More than just a \"how-to\" book, Cummings and Frost examine the process from the perspective of the writers, reviewers, editors, and readers, ranging from the newcomer to the established scholar.

  {"id":"welzBastlerSammlerSpurensucher2010","abstract":"For the history of sociology not to lose its relevance to the discipline, it should not be understood as a biographically oriented parade of recognized and forgotten classics, but rather complement sociological theory. Writing upon these premises, the historian of sociology would cease to act as the discipline's identity engineer who, considering the competitive field of theories and subjects, conservatively serves sociology to find and stabilize its historical identity. Furthermore, s/he would no longer operate as collector of ideas in search in the history of sociology for concepts of sociological analysis that were abandoned at some point, and in doing so, would cease to pursue the objective of critically undermining the dominating paradigms in contemporary sociology.On the contrary, since the ‘historic turn’ in the philosophy of science, the historian of sociology has to take up a trace-tracking role. In contrast to Robert K. Merton's stance, the theory and history of sociology should not be understood as two separate ventures. Rather, the genealogical exploration will lead to a historical epistemology of disciplinary paradigms that emphasizes that theoretical paradigms must be analyzed within the social context of their genesis. Such an approach would enable us to systematically identify the prerequisites and range of contemporary theoretical paradigms. Beyond Merton's former analysis, theory construction in sociology requires that systematic and historical reconstructions go hand-in-hand.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Welz","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"welzBastlerSammlerSpurensucher2010","container-title":"Österreichische Zeitschrift für Soziologie","container-title-short":"ÖZS","DOI":"10.1007/s11614-010-0061-0","ISSN":"1011-0070, 1862-2585","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,9,1]]},"language":"de","page":"19-37","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Bastler — Sammler — Spurensucher.

  {"id":"whiteCohesivenessBlocksSocial2001","abstract":"This study shows several ways that formal graph theoretic statements map patterns of network ties into substantive hypotheses about social cohesion. If network cohesion is enhanced by multiple connections between members of a group, for example, then the higher the global minimum of the number of independent paths that connect every pair of nodes in the network, the higher the social cohesion. The cohesiveness of a group is also measured by the extent to which it is not disconnected by removal of 1, 2, 3,..., k actors. Menger’s Theorem proves that these two measures are equivalent. Within this graph theoretic framework, we evaluate various concepts of cohesion and establish the validity of a pair of related measures: 1. Connectivity—the minimum number k of its actors whose removal would not allow the group to remain connected or would reduce the group to but a single member—measures the social cohesion of a group at a general level. 2. Conditional density measures cohesion on a finer scale as a proportion of ties beyond that required for connectivity k over the number of ties that would force it to k+ 1.Calibrated for successive values of k, these two measures combine into an aggregate measure of social cohesion, suitable for both small- and large-scale network studies. Using these measures to define the core of a new methodology of cohesive blocking, we offer hypotheses about the consequences of cohesive blocks for social groups and their members, and explore empirical examples that illustrate the significance, theoretical relevance, and predictiveness of cohesive blocking in a variety of substantively important applications in sociology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,6,19]]},"author":[{"family":"White","given":"Douglas R."},{"family":"Harary","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"whiteCohesivenessBlocksSocial2001","container-title":"Sociological Methodology","DOI":"10.1111/0081-1750.00098","ISSN":"1467-9531","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"language":"en","page":"305–359","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Cohesiveness of Blocks In Social Networks: Node Connectivity and Conditional Density","title-short":"The Cohesiveness of Blocks In Social Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0081-1750.00098/abstract","volume":"31"},
  {"id":"whiteIdentityControlStructural1992","abstract":"In proposing a comprehensive network theory that cuts across the range of social sciences, Harrison White rejects conventional hierarchical models and focuses instead on efforts of control in a social structure described as a tangle of locked-in practices. He argues that the widely held conceptions of person and goal grounded in traditional political economy do not provide a basis for social theory that is either coherent or consistent with current developments in psychology and anthropology. White replaces person with identity, which, in a distinctively human sense, emerges from frictions and social noise across different levels and disciplines in networks. Likewise he reshapes the notion of goals, maintaining that they merely inhabit sets of stories used to explain agency, and that action itself comes through selective strategies to break through formal organization. As his main empirical basis, White uses case studies covering a wide range of topics, including tribal religions, changing rhetorics of industrial administration and the premodern Church, practices of State-building, and change of style in popular music. His analyses draw from English social anthropology, natural science, French rhetorics, mathematics, German industrial history, control engineering, and American pragmatism.","author":[{"family":"White","given":"Harrison C."}],"citation-key":"whiteIdentityControlStructural1992","event-place":"Princeton","ISBN":"978-0-691-00398-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[1992]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"456","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton","source":"Google Books","title":"Identity and Control: A Structural Theory of Social Action","title-short":"Identity and Control","type":"book"},

In particular, various types of social capital employed in co-authored work and projects bridging disciplinary boundaries have attracted researchers' interest. Almost all previous studies, however, use samples with an inherent survivor bias, i.e., they focus on papers that have already been published. In contrast, our article examines the chances for getting a working paper published by using a unique dataset of 245,000 papers uploaded to arXiv. ArXiv is a popular preprint platform in Physics which allows us to construct a co-authorship network from which we can derive different types of social capital and interdisciplinary teamwork. To emphasize the 'normal case' of community-specific standards of excellence, we assess publications in Physics' high impact journals as success. Utilizing multilevel event history models, our results reveal that already a moderate number of persistent collaborations spanning at least two years is the most important social antecedent of getting a manuscript published successfully. In contrast, inter- and subdisciplinary collaborations decrease the probability of publishing in an eminent journal in Physics, which can only partially be mitigated by scientists' social capital.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Wieczorek","given":"Oliver J."},{"family":"Wittek","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Heiberger","given":"Raphael H."}],"citation-key":"wieczorekBeingPublishedSuccessfully2020","container-title":"arXiv:2006.02148 [physics]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,3]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Being published successfully or getting arXived?

To do so, we apply structural topic models to examine three research questions: (i) What are the discipline’s most prevalent research topics? (ii) How did the scientific discourse in psychology change over the last decades, especially since the advent of neurosciences? (iii) And was this change carried by high impact (HI) or less prestigious journals? Our results reveal that topics related to natural sciences are trending, while their ’counterparts’ leaning to humanities are declining in popularity.

In Auseinandersetzung mit zentralen Ansätzen der soziologischen Differenzierungstheorie zeigt er zunächst, dass es nicht die üblichen Verdächtigen sind, die ein adäquates theoretisches Vokabular zur Analyse von Ökonomisierung bereitstellen.

Sie zeigt am Beispiel des Bildungssystems, dass man in Schulen tatsächlich Prozesse der Ökonomisierung identifizieren kann. Die eigentliche Leistung der Arbeit besteht aber darin, dass sie nicht bei theoretischer Reflexion und empirischer Beschreibung stehen bleibt, sondern Mechanismen modelliert, die Ökonomisierungsprozesse in Schulen soziologisch erklären.

The complete Islamization of the financial systems of the more fundamentalist countries of Iran and Pakistan is compared with the divide between conventional interest-based systems and the new Islamic banks in Kuwait, Turkey, Egypt, Sudan and Jordan.  Islamic Financial Markets explores both international Islamic finance and the national markets in which Islamic banks operate, raising for the first time the issue of competition in Islamic banking. It also looks to the future, to retail development and wholesale possibilities which seem to be the next step forward in Islamic finance.

  {"id":"windzioImmigrantChildrenTheir2015","abstract":"The paper investigates the integration of immigrant children and their parents in different dimensions of social networks – referred to as multiplexity in social network terminology. These dimensions are children's friendships, their attendance at birthday parties, and contact among their parents. By attending birthday parties, children's friendships are publicly reinforced and membership in a social circle is signified. During these events, communication and social exchange drive the process of social integration at the micro-level, and ethnic boundaries can be shifted or blurred. It will be shown that a variety of homophily effects can be found in all three network dimensions. In addition, ethnic segregation in parents’ networks has an impact on children's participation in these events and, thereby, on children's integration in social networks. However, the causal effect in the other way around – children's birthday party attendance on contact among their parents – is even stronger. A new approach is the non-recursive analysis of how ties in one network dimension effect ties in another dimension.

Taking a multilevel ecological perspective, we also consider networks’ socio-spatial conditions. In a first step, we use ERGMs to analyze the association between parental contact and students’ friendship ties, i.e., intergenerational closure (IC). Then, we utilize spatial regressions to analyze direct and moderating effects of a school’s neighborhood on conflicts in the 135 German class networks (N = 3143 student measurements). In accordance with Coleman’s theoretical notions, we find consistent negative effects of IC on the (standardized) density of the conflict networks. Moreover, we show that IC’s impact is particularly strong in neighborhoods with a relatively high concentration of minorities. The results are in line with our theoretical considerations on multilevel network ecologies and the selective pressure of IC against conflict ties. Practically, our results provide evidence that fostering connections among parents (e.g., by implementing opportunity structures for parents to meet) might help to prevent deviating behavior in schools, especially in neighborhoods with relatively large proportions of ethnic minorities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Windzio","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Heiberger","given":"Raphael H."}],"citation-key":"windzioSocialEcologyIntergenerational2022","container-title":"Social Networks","container-title-short":"Social Networks","DOI":"10.1016/j.socnet.2021.12.009","ISSN":"0378-8733","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"language":"en","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The social ecology of intergenerational closure in school class networks.

We analyze data on multiple networks from a large-scale study of more than 2500 seventh-graders in Germany. In addition to ethnic homophily in friendship networks, our results reveal a tendency among students to dislike ethnic outgroup members (ethnic heterophobia). However, students are more likely to engage in violence towards same-ethnic peers than outgroup members. This is partly due to the greater prevalence of violence among students who are close in the friendship network and students who spend time together outside of school. Moreover, schools marked by stronger ethnic homophily in friendships tend to display higher levels of ethnic heterophobia but exhibit higher levels of intra-ethnic rather than inter-ethnic violence.

  {"id":"wlezienSaliencePoliticalIssues2005","abstract":"Salience is an important concept throughout political science. Traditionally, the word has been used to designate the importance of issues, particularly for voters. To measure salience in political behavior research, scholars often rely on people's responses to the survey question that asks about the “most important problem” (MIP) facing the nation. In this manuscript, I argue that the measure confuses at least two different characteristics of salience: The importance of issues and the degree to which issues are a problem. It even may be that issues and problems are themselves fundamentally different things, one relating to public policy and the other to conditions. Herein, I conceptualize the different characteristics of MIP. I then undertake an empirical analysis of MIP responses over time in the US. It shows that most of the variation in MIP responses reflects variation in problem status. To assess whether these responses still capture meaningful information about the variation in importance over time, I turn to an analysis of opinion-policy dynamics, specifically on the defense spending domain. It shows that changes in MIP mentions do not structure public responsiveness to policy or policymaker responsiveness to public preferences themselves. Based on the results, it appears that the political importance of defense has remained largely unchanged over time. The same may be true in other domains. Regardless, relying on MIP responses as indicators of issue importance of any domain is fundamentally flawed. The responses may tell us something about the “prominence” of issues, but we simply do not know. The implication is clear: We first need to decide what we want to measure and then design the instruments to measure it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Wlezien","given":"Christopher"}],"citation-key":"wlezienSaliencePoliticalIssues2005","container-title":"Electoral Studies","container-title-short":"Electoral Studies","DOI":"10.1016/j.electstud.2005.01.009","ISSN":"0261-3794","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,12,1]]},"page":"555-579","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"On the salience of political issues: The problem with ‘most important problem’","title-short":"On the salience of political issues","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026137940500020X","volume":"24"},

It represents for many the ideal of democracy, and in pursuit of this ideal, online discussion forums have been proposed as solutions to the practical limits to mass deliberation. Critics have pointed to evidence which suggests that online discussion has tended to undermine deliberation. This article argues that this claim, which generates a stand-off between the two camps, misses a key issue: the role played by design in facilitating or thwarting deliberation. It argues that political choices are made both about the format and operation of the online discussion, and that this affects the possibility of deliberation. Evidence for the impact of design (and the choices behind it) is drawn from analysis of European Union and UK discussion forums.

  {"id":"wuchtyHumanCommunicationDynamics2011","abstract":"Digital communication data has created opportunities to advance the knowledge of human dynamics in many areas, including national security, behavioral health, and consumerism. While digital data uniquely captures the totality of a person's communication, past research consistently shows that a subset of contacts makes up a person's “social network” of unique resource providers. To address this gap, we analyzed the correspondence between self-reported social network data and email communication data with the objective of identifying the dynamics in e-communication that correlate with a person's perception of a significant network tie. First, we examined the predictive utility of three popular methods to derive social network data from email data based on volume and reciprocity of bilateral email exchanges. Second, we observed differences in the response dynamics along self-reported ties, allowing us to introduce and test a new method that incorporates time-resolved exchange data. Using a range of robustness checks for measurement and misreporting errors in self-report and email data, we find that the methods have similar predictive utility. Although e-communication has lowered communication costs with large numbers of persons, and potentially extended our number of, and reach to contacts, our case results suggest that underlying behavioral patterns indicative of friendship or professional contacts continue to operate in a classical fashion in email interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Wuchty","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Uzzi","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"wuchtyHumanCommunicationDynamics2011","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0026972","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,11,17]]},"page":"e26972","source":"PLoS ONE","title":"Human Communication Dynamics in Digital Footsteps: A Study of the Agreement between Self-Reported Ties and Email Networks","title-short":"Human Communication Dynamics in Digital Footsteps","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0026972","volume":"6"},

Many accounts, often based on analysis of desktop-only news use, suggest that this increased choice leads to audience fragmentation, ideological segregation, and echo chambers with no cross-cutting exposure. Contrary to many of those claims, this paper uses observational multiplatform data capturing both desktop and mobile use to demonstrate that coexposure to diverse news is on the rise, and that ideological self-selection does not explain most of that coexposure. We show that mainstream media outlets offer the common ground where ideologically diverse audiences converge online, though our analysis also reveals that more than half of the US online population consumes no online news, underlining the risk of increased information inequality driven by self-selection along lines of interest. For this study, we use an unprecedented combination of observed data from the United States comprising a 5-y time window and involving tens of thousands of panelists.

We propose that principles and techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology become a more predictive science.

  {"id":"yegros-yegrosDoesInterdisciplinaryResearch2015","abstract":"This article analyses the effect of degree of interdisciplinarity on the citation impact of individual publications for four different scientific fields. We operationalise interdisciplinarity as disciplinary diversity in the references of a publication, and rather than treating interdisciplinarity as a monodimensional property, we investigate the separate effect of different aspects of diversity on citation impact: i.e. variety, balance and disparity. We use a Tobit regression model to examine the effect of these properties of interdisciplinarity on citation impact, controlling for a range of variables associated with the characteristics of publications. We find that variety has a positive effect on impact, whereas balance and disparity have a negative effect. Our results further qualify the separate effect of these three aspects of diversity by pointing out that all three dimensions of interdisciplinarity display a curvilinear (inverted U-shape) relationship with citation impact. These findings can be interpreted in two different ways. On the one hand, they are consistent with the view that, while combining multiple fields has a positive effect in knowledge creation, successful research is better achieved through research efforts that draw on a relatively proximal range of fields, as distal interdisciplinary research might be too risky and more likely to fail. On the other hand, these results may be interpreted as suggesting that scientific audiences are reluctant to cite heterodox papers that mix highly disparate bodies of knowledge—thus giving less credit to publications that are too groundbreaking or challenging.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Yegros-Yegros","given":"Alfredo"},{"family":"Rafols","given":"Ismael"},{"family":"D’Este","given":"Pablo"}],"citation-key":"yegros-yegrosDoesInterdisciplinaryResearch2015","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0135095","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,8,12]]},"language":"en","page":"e0135095","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Does Interdisciplinary Research Lead to Higher Citation Impact?

We observe that most scientists collaborate in research projects despite coordination difficulties, and without any measurable impact on their productivity.

Measurement of scientific recognition is based on survey nominations and research prizes in two growing, laboratory-intensive research domains: nanotechnology and human genetics. Curriculum vitae data is used to compare researchers based in the United States and Europe. In the early career model for the United States, we find that scientific recognition is associated with broad academic education, fast completion of PhD, and a record of independent postdoctoral research, while in Europe these factors are much less prominent. The mid-career model suggests that both in the United States and Europe fast job promotion within academia is a strong predictor of future recognition. However, there is a clear divide across the Atlantic regarding other mid-career factors: work experience inside and outside academia, research leadership, external grant income, and prizes from professional associations are connected to scientific recognition in the United States, but are less influential in Europe.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Youtie","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Rogers","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Heinze","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Shapira","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Li"}],"citation-key":"youtieCareerbasedInfluencesScientific2013","container-title":"Research Policy","container-title-short":"Research Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.respol.2013.05.002","ISSN":"0048-7333","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,9,1]]},"page":"1341-1355","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Career-based influences on scientific recognition in the United States and Europe: Longitudinal evidence from curriculum vitae data","title-short":"Career-based influences on scientific recognition in the United States and Europe","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733313000875","volume":"42"},

  {"id":"zappaAnalysisMultilevelNetworks2015","abstract":"Studies of social networks in organizations confront analytical challenges posed by the multilevel effects of hierarchical relations between organizational subunits on the presence or absence of informal network relations among organizational members. Conventional multilevel models may be usefully adopted to control for generic forms of non-independence between tie variables defined at multiple levels of analysis. Such models, however, are unable to identify the specific multilevel dependence mechanisms generating the observed network data. This is the basic difference between multilevel analysis of networks and the analysis of multilevel networks. The aim of this article is to show how recently derived multilevel exponential random graph models (MERGMs) may be specified and estimated to address the problems posed by the analysis of multilevel networks in organizations. We illustrate our methodological proposal using data on hierarchical subordination and informal communication relations between top managers in a multiunit industrial group. We discuss the implications of our results in the broader context of current theories of organizations as connected multilevel systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zappa","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Lomi","given":"Alessandro"}],"citation-key":"zappaAnalysisMultilevelNetworks2015","container-title":"Organizational Research Methods","container-title-short":"Organizational Research Methods","DOI":"10.1177/1094428115579225","ISSN":"1094-4281, 1552-7425","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,23]]},"language":"en","page":"1094428115579225","source":"orm.sagepub.com","title":"The Analysis of Multilevel Networks in Organizations Models and Empirical Tests","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://orm.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/04/22/1094428115579225"},

It is now well understood that team size is an important factor that affects the creativity of the team. However, the crucial question of how the character of research studies is related to the freshness of a team remains unclear. Here, we quantify the team freshness according to the absence of prior collaboration among team members. Our results suggest that papers produced by fresher teams are associated with greater originality and a greater multidisciplinary impact. These effects are even stronger in larger teams. Furthermore, we find that freshness defined by new team members in a paper is a more effective indicator of research originality and multidisciplinarity compared with freshness defined by new collaboration relationships among team members. Finally, we show that the career freshness of team members is also positively correlated with the originality and multidisciplinarity of produced papers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Zeng","given":"An"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Di","given":"Zengru"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yougui"},{"family":"Havlin","given":"Shlomo"}],"citation-key":"zengFreshTeamsAre2021","container-title":"Nature Human Behaviour","container-title-short":"Nat Hum Behav","DOI":"10.1038/s41562-021-01084-x","ISSN":"2397-3374","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10]]},"language":"en","page":"1314-1322","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Fresh teams are associated with original and multidisciplinary research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01084-x","volume":"5"},

The problem is essentially related to almost all scientific disciplines and thus has attracted attention of scholars from different backgrounds. Progress on SOS will lead to better solutions for many challenging issues, ranging from the selection of candidate faculty members by a university to the development of research fields to which a country should give priority. While different measurements have been designed to evaluate the scientific impact of scholars, journals and academic institutions, the multiplex structure, dynamics and evolution mechanisms of the whole system have been much less studied until recently. In this article, we review the recent advances in SOS, aiming to cover the topics from empirical study, network analysis, mechanistic models, ranking, prediction, and many important related issues. The results summarized in this review significantly deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and statistical rules governing the science system. Finally, we review the forefront of SOS research and point out the specific difficulties as they arise from different contexts, so as to stimulate further efforts in this emerging interdisciplinary field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Zeng","given":"An"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Zhesi"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Jianlin"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jinshan"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yougui"},{"family":"Stanley","given":"H.

  {"id":"zhangBayesianPredictionEarthquake2016","abstract":"Bayesian networks (BNs) are used to analyze the conditional dependencies among different events, which are expressed by conditional probability. Scientists have already investigated the seismic activities by using BNs. Recently, earthquake network is used as a novel methodology to analyze the relationships among the earthquake events. In this paper, we propose a way to predict earthquake from a new perspective. The BN is constructed after processing, which is derived from the earthquake network based on space–time influence domain. And then, the BN parameters are learnt by using the cases which are designed from the seismic data in the period between 00:00:00 on January 1, 1992 and 00:00:00 on January 1, 2012. At last, predictions are done for the data in the period between 00:00:00 on January 1, 2012 and 00:00:00 on January 1, 2015 combining the BN with the parameters. The results show that the success rate of the prediction including delayed prediction is about 65%.

In this paper, this learning problem is addressed by using a method called Mlnb which adapts the traditional naive Bayes classifiers to deal with multi-label instances. Feature selection mechanisms are incorporated into Mlnb to improve its performance. Firstly, feature extraction techniques based on principal component analysis are applied to remove irrelevant and redundant features. After that, feature subset selection techniques based on genetic algorithms are used to choose the most appropriate subset of features for prediction. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that Mlnb achieves comparable performance to other well-established multi-label learning algorithms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Min-Ling"},{"family":"Peña","given":"José M."},{"family":"Robles","given":"Victor"}],"citation-key":"zhangFeatureSelectionMultilabel2009","container-title":"Information Sciences","container-title-short":"Information Sciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.ins.2009.06.010","ISSN":"0020-0255","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,9,9]]},"page":"3218-3229","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Feature selection for multi-label naive Bayes classification","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025509002552","volume":"179"},

  {"id":"zhengExtractingCategoricalTopics2013","abstract":"Over the past few years, microblogging websites, such as Twitter, are growing increasingly popular. Different with traditional medias, tweets are structured data and with a lot of noisy words. Topic modeling algorithms for traditional medias have been studied well, but our understanding of Twitter still remains limited and few algorithms are specially designed to mine Twitter data according to its own characteristics. Previous studies usually employ only one type of topic to analyze hot topics of the Twitter community and are greatly affected by the large amount of noisy words in tweets. We have observed that, in the Twitter community, users tend to discuss two types of topics actually. One mainly focuses on their personal lives and the other on hot issues of the society. These two types of topics usually yield different distributions. In this paper, we introduce the Categorical Topic Model. This model incorporates the features of Twitter data to divide topics into two types in semantic and introduce a word distribution for background words to filter out noisy words. Our model is able to discover different types of topics efficiently, indicate which topics are interested by an user and find hot issues of the Twitter community. Employing the Gibbs sampling, we compare our model with Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Author Topic Model on the TREC2011 data set and examples of discovered public topics and personal topics are also discussed in our paper.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Zheng","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Han","given":"Kai"}],"citation-key":"zhengExtractingCategoricalTopics2013","collection-number":"8281","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"Information Retrieval Technology","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-642-45068-6_8","editor":[{"family":"Banchs","given":"Rafael E."},{"family":"Silvestri","given":"Fabrizio"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Tie-Yan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Min"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Sheng"},{"family":"Lang","given":"Jun"}],"ISBN":"978-3-642-45067-9 978-3-642-45068-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,9]]},"language":"en","page":"86-96","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Extracting Categorical Topics from Tweets Using Topic Model","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-45068-6_8"},
  {"id":"zhengNationalCultureCorporate2012","abstract":"We investigate the influence of national culture on corporate debt maturity choice. Based on the framework of Williamson, we argue that culture located in social embeddedness level can shape contracting environments by serving as an informal constraint that affects human actors’ incentives and choices in market exchange. We therefore expect national culture to be related to debt maturity structure after controlling for legal, political, financial, and economic institutions. Using Hofstede’s four cultural dimensions (uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, power distance, and masculinity) as proxies for culture, and using a sample of 114,723 firm-years from 40 countries over the 1991–2006 period, we find robust evidence that firms located in countries with high uncertainty avoidance, high collectivism, high power distance, and high masculinity tend to use more short-term debt. We interpret our results as consistent with the view that national culture helps explain cross-country variations in the maturity structure of corporate debt.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,11,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Zheng","given":"Xiaolan"},{"family":"El Ghoul","given":"Sadok"},{"family":"Guedhami","given":"Omrane"},{"family":"Kwok","given":"Chuck C.Y."}],"citation-key":"zhengNationalCultureCorporate2012","container-title":"Journal of Banking & Finance","container-title-short":"Journal of Banking & Finance","DOI":"10.1016/j.jbankfin.2011.08.004","ISSN":"0378-4266","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,2]]},"page":"468-488","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"National culture and corporate debt maturity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426611002445","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"zhongRevisitingUseWeb2019","abstract":"Advances in Big Data make it possible to make short-term forecasts for market trends from previously unexplored sources. Trading strategies were recently developed by exploiting a link between the online search activity of certain terms semantically related to finance and market movements. Here we build on these earlier results by exploring a data-driven strategy which adaptively leverages the Google Correlate service and automatically chooses a new set of search terms for every trading decision. In a backtesting experiment run from 2008 to 2017 we obtained a 499% cumulative return which compares favourably with benchmark strategies. A crowdsourcing exercise reveals that the term selection process preferentially selects highly specific terms semantically related to finance (e.g. Wells Fargo Bank), which may capture the transient interests of investors, but at the cost of a shorter span of validity. The adaptive strategy quickly updates the set of search terms when a better combination is found, leading to more consistent predictability. We anticipate that this adaptive decision framework can be of value not only for financial applications, but also in other areas of computational social science, where linkages between facets of collective human behavior and online searches can be inferred from digital footprint data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhong","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Raghib","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"zhongRevisitingUseWeb2019","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-019-50131-1","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,18]]},"language":"en","page":"1-8","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Revisiting the use of web search data for stock market movements","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-50131-1","volume":"9"},

However, as the traditional theory in behavioral finance states, the individual emotions can influence decision-making of investors, so it is reasonable to further explore this controversial topic from the perspective of online emotions, which is richly carried by massive tweets in social media. Surprisingly, through thorough study on over 10 million stock-relevant tweets from Weibo, both correlation analysis and causality test show that five attributes of the stock market in China can be competently predicted by various online emotions, like disgust, joy, sadness and fear. Specifically, the presented model significantly outperforms the baseline solutions on predicting five attributes of the stock market under the $K$-means discretization.
